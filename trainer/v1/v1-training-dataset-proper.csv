This situation happened in the twothousand election when George W. Bush won the election with more individual votes than electoral votes. This violates our constitution which states, the government is controlled by the people and allows for change if enough people in the US want it. If you've ever noticed that during the presidential election, candidates don't come to certain states. In the electoral system, each state has a winnertakeall system",0
"Dear Florida Senator, I feel as if we, as Florida citizens should be able to change election by popular votes rather than Electoral College. I understand that The Electoral College is a process that consists of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President and so forth but you don't understand how it is affecting the citizens. We are the people that vote! I am against the Electoral College process because it overrides popular vote, voters aren't really voting for president, and the process is unfair to voters.

To begin, I am against the Electoral College process because it overrides popular vote. For example, in 2000 when Al Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, he lost the presidency. The popular votes is what really counts because its the actual citizens voting not the electors. In con",0

"The Electoral College is a process put into place by the founding fathers for the purpose of electing a president. However, this process was enacted at the very beginning of the United States and the question must be asked, Is it still necessary? Or even fair? With advancing technology and better processes, the old ways of doing things must be questioned.

Almost all states have a winnertakeall system in place, with the exception of Maine and Nebraska. This system has many faults and in some cases can produce false results. A presidential candidate that wins by a large majority in a state will win the electoral votes of that state, however, if another candidate wins a very close election, heshe will also win a state. For example, in the 2000 presidential election between Al Gore and President Bush, Al Gore won the popular vote of the people but lost the election for president because of the electoral college, the very fact that we know what the popular vote was is proof of neccesity of change. Not only this, but sixty percent of voters want to vote directly. This makes it possible for a candidate to have more individual votes but less electora",0

But I disagree with the Electoral College, even though it did take me a while of thinking I came to the conclusion that an all out popular vote is more efficient when it comes to voting for a president than the electoral college, and there is three main reasons that swung me to side with popular vote, First of all, when you get right down to it the Electoral College just doesnt give perfect accuracy on who does actually get the exact most votes. Some people cant completely grasp this fact but imagine that there is Florida, Alaska, and Montana. The first candidate, which we shall call John and the second, Bill, are going for these three states. John beats Bill on Florida 5,000 to 4,999 and John gets all 29 electoral votes because of that, tough luck for Bill.

"Using a motor vehicle as a source of transportation is part of everyday life and is not rare to the stereotypical American. But cities such as Paris, Bogota, and Vauban are all striving towards reducing the rate of motor vehicle usage in their areas. Advantages of limiting car usage are lower greenhouse gas rates, suburbs can become more compact and more accessible to public transportation, and people are able to live less stressful lives.

Transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions and is responsible for fifty percent of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States but is slowly making a change towards helping the environment and being beneficial towards carbon emissions. In 2005, the number of miles driven in the United States was at it's highest rate. As time went by, the numbers started dropping and getting lower. Many sociologits believe that if the numbers get even lower and stay at that rate, the benefits will come for the environment but unfortunately not for car companys.

"""You can live in your car, but you can't drive your house."" This is a quote my teacher used to tell me as advise for the future. This was a way of saving money if you had to choose between paying rent or paying your car bills if you were in this situation. However, what he did not realize is its more useful to use less of your car.

Using less of your car improves the environment. Using less will reduce the pollution in the air that we breathe in. When we reduce our car use we reduce the amount of resources like fossil fuels and nonreuseable resources. When we use cars and create pollution we also create a smog, but when we stop using cars we can clear the smog. In paris, they banned car use for a certain amount of time and it reduced the amount of smog. In fact, in the article Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog , it says ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday.""

"Limiting car usage is a very good idea. It can save a lot of money, keep pollution from happening,and keep people safe. If more people tend to save money because of cars, then they can buy more stuff. If more people save the environment people can have fresh air to breath in. Multiple resources have been found to support the idea that limiting car use can save a lot of money and make the environment safer.

In the twentyfirst century, it may seem that possessing a car is a vital aspect of living, however, that is not always the case.

To began with, having a limited amount of cars on the roads means a less amount of car emission that stays in the air. Carbon emissions from cars are responsible from around 50% of the greenhouse gases in the United States alone Source 1. If we were to limit our car usage, it is very likely for that percentage to go down. Taking the account that cars are the second most item that pollutes the air, it would be a dramatic change for the environment to be a cleaner and heathier place to live Source 4.

In source 3, Bogota, Colombia millions of columbians hike, bike, skate, or took buses to work during a day they call carfree day because they want to reduce air pollution.

In the United States one out of every 4 person is obese, and the reduction of car usage will help limit the obesity rate. Walking or even biking from one place to another is a work out and that is a common way to lose weight. We try so hard to reduce obesity and one of the many ways to gain weight is to eat junk food and not jog, run, or walk it off.

This is because you do not have to worry about wrecking your car, keeping up with the insurance payments, talking care of it such as oil changes and eventually, having to buy a new one which can be very expensive.

Another reason why not having a car is beneficial is that it can help the environment. Right now, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of Greenhouse gas emissions in Europe.

"""The day that mankind realizes that their creations destroy the true beauty of mother nature it will be too late."" This quote by one of our nations greatest political and environmental activists, Irvin Green, directly applies to the topic of reducing pollution. One simple, yet extremely effective way to reduce pollution is limiting the transportation methods we travel by. Limiting car and vehicle usage can reduce pollution, nearly eliminate accidents, and makes the road a safer place.

In many places such as Germany, Paris, and Columbia, many ambitious ideas are being put into play to help battle pollution. In the article, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", it is stated that in Vauban Germany, 70 percent of families do not own vehicles. The other 30% that do, do not have a place to park them, making them basically useless. Residents in Vauban have stopped their need for transportation, making malls and stores a walk away. In this new approach, pollution has drastically reduced in numbers and has made it a much safer and cleaner place to live.

Some people may also say that the Electoral college encourages the president to visit all states, when in fact smaller states still are not treated the same as states with more electoral votes.

The disaster factor is the risk that the electors could always defy the will of the people.

Back in the times in which the Electoral Collage was founded, commutation between the colonies was not quick.

Well, I dont think that it is right, and there are some reasons I am about to tell you that may change your mind about the whole process of voting and electing a president. Here are a few points I am going to cover in this essay about Electoral Colleges: over sixty percent of people do not agree with the electoral process, it it outdated and not accurate, also the electors have proven to be untrustworthy in the past.

Most people dont really understand what the Electoral College is, or what it is about, so let me just inform you about it a little. The Electoral College is a process that was established in the constitution and it is a strategy that we use to elect out presidents. The citizens vote for the president, but so the the electors in the Electoral College. There are over five hundred members of the Electoral College, and if a candidate wants to win presidency, heshe has to gain 270 of the Electoral College's votes. Each person running has a set of their own electors. Many people believe that this should not be used as ",0
"After World War II cars began to become more and more popular, and ever since then they cars have done more harm than good, air pollution, traffic and just harming health are a few things cars have harmed citizens with. Many cities are doing things to help cut down the ""smog"" in their area by creating driving bans for a day or even a week Paris bans driving due to smog 10 PBDS. It starts with one and grows into something much larger, and hopefully that shows in this situation. This essay is going to go into detail on why it is needed to cut back on car usage and maybe one day cars will not be needed.

People began pointing the finger at diesels for the air pollution in France after it was made obvious that they make up 67% of the vehicles in this area, compared to around 50% in the other parts of Western Europe PBDS 16. Greenhouse gasses are harming our atmosphere by trapping the warm air in",0
"Driving a car around can be very a affective aspect in people's lives it can also be a very stressful and dangerous liferisking task to do each and every day. All across America, citizens are constantly driving their cars. A car can be used to go to work, to the grocery store, or to drop a loved one off to school and even other places. It is to the point were a simple car has become an important necessity to manage everyday life. It is also to a point at which every year cars are responsible for thousands of deaths and accidents. If people around the world limited their car usage everyday it could significantly better our lives.

Clear the air. Pollution from cars has severely polluted the air we breathe and our environment. Beijing, China is know as one of the most polluted cities in the world and has been effected my the smog. Many places around the world are trying to make a difference in their environment by trying to get citizens in that area to limit their driving. According to an excerpt from ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, Paris has enforced a parital driving ban to help clean the air of the global city. As stated in the excerpt, ""On Monday m",0
"Do you own a car? Have you ever driven one? Many people would answer yes to these questions, and would agree that cars , in fact, are very useful. But have you ever thought of the advantages that would occur if we limited car usage? While cars are very useful, they also have lots of negative side affects that come along with it. Cars accumulate lots of pollution in the environment and stress to humans. Also less cars, results in less traffic, which means you will be wasting less of you're life waiting to get somewhere and actually being there in the moment. Whether you realize it or not Americans are already starting to cut down on car usage. In the article ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, it even states ""recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" The world has been struggling with pollution for quite some time now and has been trying to come up with ways to cut it down. So why not start with where it derives from the most? Cars. Pollution by cars got so bad in Paris that they had to use license plate numbers to decide what cars could driv",0
"Transportation has been a part of society for as long as the worlds been turning. It all depends what mode of transport you are willing to take on a daily basis. Cars are becoming fewer and fewer in some places of the past few years. People are less dependant on personal transportation which in turn creates a safer, healthier environment for ourselves and the others around us.

By limiting car usage the main reaction would be less pollution and less smog in larger cities. Places like New York, Paris, Berlin, London, or Beijing could look so much better. Everywhere you look you see and hear about pollution and Greenhouse Gases and Global Warming. All this is caused mainly by humans hand and the cars we drive spitting out toxic Carbon Dioxide wastes. In Paris they had a one day ban of half the cars in the city and the smog went away in that amount fo time.Source 2 If we limited cars we could unlimit our world to a new, longer lifespan, because cars are truly ripping our planet to pieces.

"Dear Senator PROPER_NAME, As you are well aware, elections in the United States are of extreme importance. Therefore, it is vital to have the best system possible when electing officials. Maintaining the current system of Electoral College would be a fatal mistake to our country. We must elect candidates by popular vote alone.

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Pulumer, ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. because of the winnertake all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states."" Americans who are voting the the next president should have the right to hear what candidates have to say. They may be the only one in their state who is not a democrat, but shouln't their vote still be heard.

The article also states that, ""Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to t",0
"Dear Rick Scott, Every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday of November, the Electoral College casts their votes to elect the new President of the United States of America. These voters are chosen by the citizens of their state Florida, Texas, etc. to vote in their favor of their preferred party. For example, a Democratic voter in California will vote for Democratic Electoral College candidates to vote for their preferred President. Though many people are opposed to this method of voting, calling it an anachronism & taking away the vote from the citizens of the United States, American citizen's votes still count, the Electoral College can avoid problems popular voting could result in, and the Electoral College listens to those with the initiative and right to make a smart vote. For these reasons I would like to keep the Electoral College.

The Founding Fathers established the Electoral College as a compromise between election of the President by a vote of Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens, meaning one vote almost relies on the other. A common misconception made by citizens is that when they vote they vote f",0
"Ah, the electoral college. Don't you just how irrelevant, unfair, and confusing it is? In fact, it is so without flaw, that in 2000, Al Gore won the popular vote, but he lost the presidency Source 2. Some people say that the electoral college is an anachronism, but some people disagree. Those people are wrong. The electoral college was irritating in the 1960's, and it's irritating now. You should side with Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and the Chamber of Commerce Source 2, and abolish the electoral college.

First, and most importantly, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Most states in the electoral college is based on a ""winner take all"" system if the candidate gets the majority of votes in that state, that candidate gets the electors Source 1. This means most candidates focus in on the states they know that they have a chance of winning, and focus on going after ""swing states"" Source 2. If a candidate was to g",0
"Dear State Senate, I feel that the way we, the people, vote today is very unfair. We should change the voting to popular vote for the president of the United States. The majority of people don't care about voting for the next United States president because they don't get to chose who will win. The people that get to vote for one's state might not think about what what the remaining others would want.

In source one, this section tells the reader what an electoral college is and how it works. Paragraph two sums up what this system is, ""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president, and the counting if the electoral votes by Congress."" Basically what this paragraph was saying is that the people dont get to directly say who they want as president. The people of a state get to vote for who they want, but it is ultimately up to the state electors on who will get the vote from that partic",0
"Men are like ants. We are always in a rush and always desperate to arrive on time. The easiest way to arrive on time in any place, is by car. Cars, however, tend to do a lot more bad then they do good. Cars release large amounts of pollution and can raise smog and noise levels in areas where there is a lot of driving. Smog and pollution isn't very good for anybody, so some areas have taken preventative steps to keep Earth healthy and to keep people healthy as well. The shocking part is, the cars get cut out.

In some areas, like the experimental Vauban in Germany, cars are not allowed at all. No honking is heard when the sun rises, and streets are oddly empty. Shops are lined up within walking distance, and few buses run to allow for people to travel a little bit quicker. In fact, 70% of vaughn's population do not own cars, and many sold their cars for a chance to live in Vauban. The streets are safer, ",0
"In our society today, limiting car usage would be the best way to go. There are plenty of advantages to limiting car usage, with a decrease in pollution just to name one of them. If we can capitalize on the downward shift of automobile users in the United States and around the world, then it would benefit all of us in more ways then one.

Having a car can be handy to get from point A to point B, but what if you just do not need to use that car at all? What if you are just to lazy to walk or bike to your destination? I am not saying you should walk 80 miles to your aunt's house, but what if it was just to the store that was a half of a mile away. Not to mention that you would be saving good on gas money. There is a mostly car free suburb, for example, in Germany that focuses on a majority of the population of the neighborhood to not use cars. This town is named Vauban, and 70 percent of families do not own a car here. It may sound bad to those who live and die by their car, but with everything in walking distance it makes it easy and accessible to walk from point A to point B most of the time. The re",0
"The time of the founding fathers is long gone. Times have changed which means we have to change our way of thinking. Our way of voting. The Electoral college needs to be replaced by popular vote elections because the Electoral College discourages people from voting for their preferred president, influences future presidents to ignore some states, and does not clearly reflect the views of the American people.

Initially, by keeping the Electoral College individuals are less incentivized to vote if they know there is little chance it will do anything. ""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election"" Source 3, 23. However, by implementing popular vote, many more people will want to vote knowing that even if their side does not get the majority vote ",0
"State Senator, The Electoral College is outdated, and is commonly viewed as anachronism. In this system voters, instead of voting for a president, vote for a slate of electors. The slate of electors if chosen for the statewide election, would go to Congress. At Congress, they would then vote for the President. For many people, it seems understandably unfair.

First off, voters cannot control who their electors vote for. At this point in time, voters have no more of a say in which President is elected they can only hope that the elected candidate shares the same views they do. Most of the times, this is the wrong case.

Second off, many times voters will get confused in who they're voting for. They'll pick out a candidate without knowing much information about them, or what their views are. A random candidate will be chosen for their vote, and most times this tends to come to an unhappy ending. Many times, voters will be disappointed and frustrated with how the election turns out.

People claim this tends to be due to the Electoral College.

"When cars were first introduced into society it was the most awestruck phenomenon to occur. There was nothing better than the sight of a person's first car and the feeling of independence that came with it. But now that technology has shorten distances between countries and has made telecommunication so much more accessible. People should engage in limiting their car usage because it betters personal health, improves the environment, and leads to economic prosperity while still gaining all the benefits that come from using a car.

When the usage of cars is limited it often leads to better health benefits. This is true because when people are restricted on their driving it forces them to resort to healthier, more proactive alternatives. For example, instead of driving somewhere people are now having to get out and walk or ride a bike. This leads to regular exercise without having to think about it and decreases o",0

Reducing car usage would be excellent for our environment. Research shows us that ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States""Rosenthal. Our world is very materialistic and sometimes we forget that to even have life, we must have the environment. ""Cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities""Rosenthal. Therefore, limiting the amount of cars would allow us to have more efficient green houses, and more land area for plants.

"Dear Senator, There have been multiple arguments on wether or not the Electoral College should be used for electing the President. Electing a President by the Electoral College is a better idea than electing a president through popular vote. Representatives know what is right for their country while most of American citizens would not make the right decisions, and sometimes do not even make any decisions at all.

First off, citizens themselves elect their own state representatives for the House of Representatives. They vote for them for many reasons. The representatives are well educated. The people vote for the representatives, and in return, they expect and trust the representatives to make the right decisions for them.Electing a new president is a pretty big deal and should be taken care of in the hands of the trusted representatives.

For example if you limit your car use to 3 times a week you would save a ton of money. Also you would help get rid of pollution as it states in the article ""Pairs bans driving due to smog"" that congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of france after 5 day of intensifying smog. That happened after five days the smog cleared up enough and they let people start driving again. Also if you limit your car use you could start doing some excersie which is great because the rate of obesity may drop. Also if you limit your self from driving you are less likely to be in a car accident.

"The world is facing incredibly drastic climate change due to car emissions and power plants, both are burning fossil fuels. Things may look bad, almost irreversible but the sun has not yet set, there's hope and it comes in the shape of a shifting world wide attitude towards vehicles.

Reducing the temperature of a rapidly heating planet will allow us to savour our oceans rather than running from them as they grow to envelop our costal cities. It will relieve stress from those who had been trapped in a car all day and last, but not least, it's not difficult and one wont be alone in their endeavors.

"We should keep our method of chosing a president even though many dont agree because of a few reasons. One, big states. Two, avoid run off elections. Finnaly, to determine the certainty of outcome.

First, the issue of big states. States are put in two categories, big states and small states, according to population. Presidential candidates give more of their attention during the campaign to the larger states. As a result of electoral college the big states have more electors and thus more votes. For example, in Forida, the popular vote was extremely close in 2012, Obama who won, got 29 electoral votes. If obama had spent that time in Wyoming, he would have only had gotten 3 electoral votes.

Second, to avoid run off elections. Using the electoral college we avoid the problem of elections where no candidate receives a majority. the electoral college can produce a clear winner rather than pressure when no candidate wins majority and complications of the process. Two examples of this in 1968 and 1992 with president nixon and president Clinton. They both had 43 percent plurality of popular vote, while winning a majority of electoral college.

"Dear senator, I strongly believe that we should demolish the electoral college system. It is highly unfair and can cause the wrong person to win. The system also has and will continue to cause controversy and rightfully so.

To begin with, the electoral college system is extremely unfair. With this system in play it is fairly easy for the wrong candidate to be elected it has happened before where the person with the most popular votes meaning they had the majority rule has lost because of the way the opposing system is run. This occasion may occur from time to time because when voting you are voting for the electors not the actual president that you want to win. The system is very faulty and there is no guarantee that the electors will vote for whom they are saying they will.

"Although a motorized vehicle provides the opportunity to transport citizens from place to place, limiting the usage of a car may be considered more beneficial.

When individuals are stressed, they're constantly worrying and not fully paying attention to surroundings therefore, stress is considered one of the causes of vehicle crashes.

To avoid having that title of cities decided to take action.

Cities like Mexico City, Paris, and bogotaColombia, have certain days a week when certain cars can not be driven due to pollution that it may cause.

In the passage it states ""After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" The pollution was out of control and for the most part it was because of the huge amount of car usage. The effect of banning car usage was resulting in an amazing outcome, less pollution, which is healthier for the community. The advantage of limiting car usage can effect a whole community and one way is less pollution. Bogota, Colombia had the same idea but they were not banning the car usage they have one day called the carfree day to show that its an advantage not to use cars all the time.

"Dear Florida Senator, Our country, the United States of America, elects our presidents by something that is called the Electoral College. The Electoral College is a selection of 538 electors who vote to elect the president. The popular Presidential vote ties into the Electoral College by when a person votes for a presidential candidate, that person also votes for their chosen panel of electors from that state. Many citizens of the United States believe that this electing process is unfair and takes away the freedom to elect our President, but the Electoral College is fitting for our country because the candidates can campaign in all regions and that there will not be as big as a dispute in the Electoral College election than a popular election.

To begin with, the United States should keep the Electoral College for the presidential election because the candidates campaign in all the regions.

The United States election process has worked very efficiently for many years with this process of election, it is very effective for choosing a candidate, and when it comes down to it, the last process of the Electoral College House of Representatives stepping in when there is a tie is very unbiased and is also effective in choosing a candidate. If we were to abolish the Electoral College, the United States government would basically be starting over with their election process, which isn't necessarily a good idea once you are nearly 300 years into being an official country.

"In today's society, when people are asked if they would give up their cars, they would be shocked. No would be the most common answer. However, the advantages of limiting car usage are great. General stress decreases, and pollution to the environment also decreases. People are not only helping themselves, but also helping the ecosystem.

Stress. Everyone has it but what if it could be decreased just by using personal transportation less? In Germany, there are certain communities that ban car usage. No cars are allowed inside the city. Street parking, driveways, and home garages have become obsolete. One citizen of one of the towns said, ""When I had a car I was always tense.

"Dear State Senator, Once a year, people all over the United States of America gather to vote for the most powerful men in the country our President and Vice President. We should have the people of America be able to vote for who they want their president to be because the Electoral College has some major flaws and simply because people have their rights. I believe that we should let the people be able to make their own choices.

The Electoral College has major flaws. Something bad is bound to happen if we keep letting them make the people's decisions. Source A in paragraph 12 states, ""In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election In 1976 a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way."" The election is literally only a few swing voters away from a catastrophe. It would be hard to believe that the people of the United States would want to be embarrassed because we can't even choose a presidential leader correctly. The other countries would take us as a joke we would simply look like fools. Another thing is, what would we do if th",0
"The electoral college is one of the most heavily criticized institutions in the American government system. It has been considered outdated and antidemocratic. However, without it, the balance of power in America would be skewed to an unacceptable degree. States with large populations would be disproportionately empowered, without the electoral college. This leaves the smaller states existence to be controlled by the larger states, to the dismay of the American economy and people.

As it stands, most states vote in a way that presents a united front of electors to the electoral college. If just over half of the Californian voters vote for one candidate that they think would represent their interests, the map in source 3 shows that all 55 electors will present their votes to the college. It is better for California to be represented in this way so that the Californian economy would not be adversely effected by their minority voters. That sort of united front ",0
"The electoral college is how america chooses its president. The electoral college should not be how you think voting works but the complete opposite. It is a process that consist of electors who count the electoral votes. When a citizen votes their vote does not go directly as a vote for the president but it goes for the electoral college in your state. If that state has more votes for one candidate than the other then that state votes for that for that candidate as a whole. If the person I vote for doesn't get the vote for my state then that defeats the purpose of me voting. The electoral college takes away my say in choosing a president, the fairness, and it might have been put in the Constitution by the founding fathers but it is outdated.

The first reason why the electoral college shouldn't be used",0
"It is in the best interest of the people that you do away with the Electoral College. When people vote, they want it to be a direct vote to the election, not a vote for their chosen candidate's electors. The Electoral College should be abolished because it doesn't guarantee your vote, the House's selection can't be expected to reflect the will of the people, and swing voters could cause a catastrophe.

To begin, the Electoral College should be abolished because it doesn't guarantee your vote. As stated before, when you vote, there is no say in who actually wins the election. You are voting for electors who then vote for the President. While it is a rare occurrence, those Electors may betray you and vote for the other party, cancelling your vote totally out. If a candidate gets the most popular votes, that doesn't guarantee them as President, because they still have to get the Electoral College's votes.

First, you have to vote for the electorss not the president. Then only if they win there votes go through. You can't even control who the electorss vote for. Voters sometimes get confused on who there voting for and vote for the wrong electors. Over sixty percent of voters would prefer a direct election than what we have now.

Although it has been used for so long and some what effectively, I believe that the act of changing the process to election by popular vote would benefit the country and the residents more. Many poeple do think that the Electoral College is more fair and is better because of its certain outcome and other good aspects. My belief about the electoral College differs. I believe it is unfair and outdated, and I am not alone on that opinion.

An argument against the Electoral college is the disaster factor, information from the passage The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer. In 2000, the biggest election crisis took place in a century. In 1960, segregationists almost had success in replacing electors with people who would benefit them. Along with that, some electors may not be truthful and defy those who they are electing for and elect the opposer. All these examples come with fault in the system.

"Every four years, the United States is turned into a political battleground by the campaign for presidency. The electoral College, the voting method used since the nation began, Is being highly questioned on its efficiency now vs the efficiency 250 years ago. However, the system has survived because it works. Despite its flaws, the Electoral College does a good job of simplifying the presidential election and eliminating disputes or a potential crisis. It produces a clear winner, it makes sure that the president is popular in all areas of the country, and it puts the weight of the campaign on the swing states.

In most presidentai races, the president wins only by a small margin. rarely is there a landslide victory or a complete vote for a president. This small majority can lead to many disputes over the credibility of counting the votes in the individual states. This is why the Electoral College helps the voting process. The Electoral College helps the voting process because it produces a more clear winner. For example, in line 21 it claims that ""In 2",0

I believe that you should get rid of the electoral collage method and change it to the popular voting method because its fair to the voters, YOU are able to vote for the president of your choice, and because of the winnertakeall system. You need to think about everyone in the all the states not just electing your president. Your people need to agree with the choice that has been made.

The electoral collage should be changed to the popular voting method because it is unfair to the voters. everyone should have a say in what goes on where ever it is that they live.

"When the US Constitution was first made, the idea of equality between the states was made. This meant that the size or population of a state gave it no distinct advantage over another. They did this through the creation of the House of Representatives and the Senate, yet there was one more issue they had to solve. This issue was how they could count the votes of citizens all aroun the US fairly. They solved it with electoral college, a system in which the voters don't directly vote for the president, but vote for a group, or slate, of people who have sworn to a candidate who vote for you. This system as Source 2 states can easily be broken with a group of swing votes in some states, but because it keeps thing equal, we must see that making popular vote the process isn't a good idea, because larger states will have more power.

Many people don't understand the damage that driving all of the time is doing to our world. But, limiting car usage has many advantages that come along with it.

Limiting car usage come along with many advantages. One advantage of limiting car usage is that you can limit the amount of smog that goes into the air and also into your lungs. In source 2 it says, ""After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.

The first reason that changing the system is a good idea is that lots of people think that it is unfair.

In modern times however, most citizens agree that popular vote makes more sense and that the electoral college has become rather bloated. In the case of finding reasons of why the electoral college doesn't really work is because private citizens vote for someone else to vote and that voters from different states don't control who the electors choose.

Lets start off with the first reason why we should keep the Electoral College. The first reason is the big states. I probably have confused you but let me explain to you what I mean. The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the malapportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. For example, in 2012 the popular vote was really close in Florida nevertheless Obama, who won that vote. In other words, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does.

The second reason why is, avoiding runoff elections. The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had onl",0

In the article, "" Paris Bans Driving Due To Smog"", the author, Robert Duffer, talks about France banned driving in order to clean the polluted air.

Most of the vehicles in Paris have diesel fuel rather than gasoline, in which they favor due to a tax policy. ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party"".

In source number 2, Bradford Plumer states, ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."". In other words, your vote is basically in the hands of someone else, and hopefully they vote for who you want what's even worse is electors are picked on at state conventions, sometimes state party's central committee, or even sometimes the presidential candidates, so you, the citizens don't get to pick the elector. Voters can not always control who their electors vote for and voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate.

""Under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for President, but for a slate of electorss, who in turn elect the President."" The sitation before states that it is not the President the voters are voting for, it is actually the electorss that the people are voting for, who in turn will vote for the President. This situation does not allow for the people to directly vote for who they believe will be the best President. It is really in the hands of the electorss who will become President.

Secondly, after realizing that the number of electorsal votes decides if you become President or not, the Presidential candidates are going to want to focus on obtaining the most votes as possible. After determining which states they ""have in the bag"", the candidates are going to put their campaigning efforts toward the ""tossup"" or ""swing states"".

"The Electoral College is the cause of many political disagreements and problems whenever mentioned. Although established in the constitution, it is seen as undemocratic by many. The Electoral College takes away the ability of citizens to vote for their president instead they are voting for Electors, not always loyal to the candidate. As a result, I believe the Electoral College should only be used in instances of a tie between two candidates.

Each presidential candidate has a group of Electors, which will be part of the Electoral College process after the popular vote is taken. The Electoral College process consists of the selection of electors, the meeting in which the vote for both President and Vice President occurs, and then the votes are counted by Congress.

The popular voting method is not only a direct vote for the desired candidate of the people's choice, but this method is also less complicated, leaving less room for many problems.

Initially the Electoral College voting method sounded like a great idea but over recent study some people are beginning to become more fond of the popular voting method.

For example, a car is a major part of the human society. We use cars to get from place to place and we're always making new versions. If you look back during the 1930s1950s, cars weren't used as often we use them. If you were to look around, you would see families, men, and women walking alongside the road. During that time period, cars were not used constantly unless it was necessary. Presently, many people believe that humans should limit car usage. There are some countries that banned cars for a short time period. such as, Paris,France and Bogota, Columbia. There are also some areas that completely banned car usage forever.

Instead of huge car garages and parking lots we could save a lot of room, and use that room to build cheap houses for people in need.

But still their own say during the presidential Elections are useless, the only real true thing to do is vote for the Senate Electors for the Presidential elections since the Electoral College process is mainly controlled by the Senate, the Senators vote for the Presidential candidate.

I feel like we, as a country, could avoid a great deal of dispute that arises, regarding the electoral college voting system, if it were changed to election by popular vote.

First of all, when the electoral college voting system is used, while people may think they are voting for a presidential candidate, they are not. Voters are actually choosing a group of electors that then elect a president. Shouldn't something that has a great impact on our country, such as electing the president of the United States, be chosen by the people living in the country under the president's decisions?

"Dear Senator, The electoral college is a process that the founding fathers established as a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and popular vote of the people. This process involves selecting the electors, meeting with the electors, and counting the votes by congress. There are 538 electors total in the Electoral College. The presidential election happens every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. After the election the governor makes a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" which has all the names of the candidates who ran for President. I believe we should keep the Electoral College because there is a certainty of outcome, it helps avoid runoff elections, and the electoral college helps balance out the smaller and bigger states with more people that vote.

The outcome of an Electoral College has a possibility of creating a dispute like in 2000, but this dispute is less likely to happen over a dispute over the popular vote. This is because the winning candidates share of the Electoral College is greater than his share of the popular vote. Obama received 61.7 p",0
"Driving is the primary way of transportation, to get from point A to point B. It's a great way to reduce traveling time, and traffic is almost nonexistent. Some people would say it's better than walking, or riding a bicycle. But what if we limited these polluting vehicles and replaced our transportation for our daily routine? Well, we can. Limiting car usage can help us from lots of city andor regional pollution. It can improve safety and conserve the resources we already have. Saving even more time is also something all people want to try to accomplish. Limiting the use of cars can help make this world a much better, and more breathable, reusable, and not a timeconsuming place.

To begin with, the answer to why we should limit the use of cars is stated in the form of pure science: pollution.

"Limiting car usage is beneficial to more than just the environment, it is also beneficial to humans. With all the pros and very few cons of limiting car usage, it would be impractical to not make the change. Some may argue that it would waste time to limite car usage, however, if widespread limitation of car usage occurs then the way we live will evolve to adapt to life without much car usage, making it far more convenient in the future.

A common misconception is that limiting car use is solely beneficial to the environment. In paragraph three a resident of Vauban is quoted saying, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" this shows that humans too can take advantage of limiting car use. In common culture today, destinations are far spread out and not compact unless in a large city. This is because it is possible to transport one's self those distances in a car. Limiting car use would effect the suburban culture of being spread out and change it into a more compact, convenient environment.

"Cars have been popular and widely used ever since they were invented. They offer a fast and efficient form of transportation across both long and short distances. In this aspect, cars may appear extremely beneficiary and useful in everyday life, but there are always downsides to great inventions, especially the invention of the car. More and more people from all around the world are realizing the harms that car usage brings and are beginning to abandon their cars altogether. The most apparent reason as to why cars are damaging is because of the great amount of greenhouses gases they emit into the atmosphere. They also bring about pollution and smog with them. Finally, and maybe surprisingly to some, people are actually happier without these pollution monsters.

To start, cars expel shocking amounts of greenhouses gases from their tailpipe. By limiting usage of these automobiles, the amount of green house gases can be significantly reduced. According to the source, In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, cars produce up to 12 percent of the greenhouse gas emissio",0
"For more than a hundred years now, we have been relying on automobiles for many things. Since the beginning, we've seen a tremendous increase due to the more factories built and more company founded to create different versions and models of cars. We use them to go place to place. However, it does have its downfall. The majority of pollution caused by cars driven around the entire planet is caused by the emissions released from the car itself. Obviously that's nowhere near healthy so why not try limiting the car usage?

Many places round the world have already begun trying little projects inorder to cut back on smog or pollution. In Vauban, Germany, for example, a tremendous amount of people don't own cars. According to the excerpt from ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, it mentions how 70 percent of vaughn's families do not own cars and 57 percent sold one to move there.

If the usage of cars is cut down, then the amount of pollution in the air will be less. A less usage of cars allows people to have a clean community and helps the environment.

In Germany, there is a small community that is completely carfree. This community, Vauban, has about 5,500 residents, and not a single one of them use a car. This community is very clean and all of the people that live there are happy. Just think, what if every family in Vauban had a car? It would completely change this happy, clean community.

"Throughout time, pollution has been known to be a huge environmental problem. The excessive amount of individual car owners driving down streets is in no way helping this issue. Efforts to diminish the number of cars we see on our roads have been taking place in order to help the environment and therefore citizens as well.

It is no news that passenger cars are harmful to the environment. They release gases that pollute the air we breathe affecting not only us but the environment as a whole. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of green house gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some areas in the United States Source 1. This realization has led to the promotion of ""carreduced"" communities by the U.S Environmental Protection Agency Source 1. But the problem is more widespread than that. Paris has acknowledged the importance of this issue after witnessing smog that rivaled Beijing, China, known as one of the most polluted cities in the world Source 2.

Along with many advantages, there should be a limit of car usage worldwide.

In the article paris bans driving due to smog, it explains the drastic change in smog formation, leading Paris officials to temporarily ban driving. Though a small percentage citizens citywide ignored the ban, the pollution was lessened enough to end the law after a day.

This new trend involves walking, bike riding, and other types of public transportation. Certain cities, like Vauban and Paris, have started to set limitations on car usage.

"Even though the Electoral College is known as a disaster factor, it has its benefits. The Electoral College is a process that consists of the selection of the electors. Each candidate running in your state has his or her own group of electors that are voted for. When you vote on election day, which is held every four years on Tuesday after the first Monday in november, you vote for the candidate's electors. Many politicians wanted to abolish the Electoral College because of its lack of democratic pedigree, but the college doesn't allow voters of other regions to feel disenfranchised, it avoids runoff elections, and thinks that the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.

The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have a transregional appeal. It would not be fair for a candidate to campaign heavily in a state that they know they are going to win. This does not gain them any electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows will win. This causes voters that are from the opposite region to feel as if their votes did not count, that thei",0
"Not a day goes by that you don't see a car passing by on the street. Often, we don't think much of it and the effects it has. Throughout the world there are communities campaigning, trying to lower the usage of motor vehicles. The citizens in these communities are aware of all the cons that come with driving cars. There are plenty of benefits to not driving cars everyday such as, lower the amount of air pollution, being inclined and motivated to exercise often, and the money that this act can save.

The number of cars being purchased in America has been dwindling with each year that passes. If this pattern persists it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment. This is due to the fact that transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just barely behind the power plants. At one point in Paris, France, there was an extreme case of congestion which provided the air with more than its fare share of smog. The city was told to momentarily stop the driving of motor vehicles. congestion went down 60 percent after ",0
"Dear, state senator I think we should change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. I think this because the Electoral College does not seem fair, the president that usually wins in popular vote loses to the vote for presidency, it is considered a nondemocratic method for selecting a president, and it is all up to the electors of a candidate. The Electoral College should also be changed to popular vote because it is not the people who are choosing the president, it is the three electors sent from each different state.

The Electoral College should be changed to election by popular vote, because it is not fair to the candidates. This is because most presidents that win the popular vote section of the election then end up losing the presidential vote section, an example of this is when candidate Al Gore received the most individual votes when running against George W. Bush, but Bush won the electoral section, receiving two hundred and seventyone against Al Gore's two hundred and sixtysix.

When you vote for a candidate you trust they will vote for who they say they will. but is it always true? what is the candidate feels like they dont agree with that person any more and vote for a different one? You and everybody else who voted for that canadaite are now voting for an opposing candidate. is that fair to who ever voted for that candidate now?

You can never be sure if you are voting right. what if that candidate dose not vote like they are supposed too. ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for?

"The President of the United States is currently determined by an electoral college. The electoral college process involves the public voting for their elector and not the main focus, the candidates. Through this, many of the states gain more power than they should, and the votes are set up as a ""Winnertakesall"" system. This unnecessary and inaccurate use of votes is outdated and needs to be shut down.

In an instant, an electoral college voter could change his or her mind and go against his or her original political party. This is a completely unfair use of power because it reverses all of the votes that went to the elector and to all of the voters who were counting on the elector to properly represent their vote. The voters have no say in whether the elector will stay true to his or her party.

The easiest way to prove that the electoral college must go, is to reveal the facts. In source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College it states ""over sixty percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now"". Multiple icons such as Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, B",0

The advantages of limiting car usage is reducing the amount of fuel the we use, we would save thousands of dollars, and become more green in the world.

"Dear state senator, I personally believe that we should stick to and continue the idea of the Electoral College. For one, there are trusted electors in the Electoral College that are trusted to vote for the right candidate. Secondly, there isn't much that can go wrong in the Electoral College. Last but not least, by electing a president of the United States through popular vote, the right person may not be elected to be president for our country.

To start off, there are trusted electors in the Electoral College that are trusted by the parties to make the right vote for president. The Electoral College is a system that was created by the founding fathers created in the Constitution. When voters go off to the polls most have the thought in their mind that they are voting for their next president when they really are not. In the Electoral College there are 538 electors, which ever candidate gets the majority of 270 electoral votes wins the election. In source 3, the passage states ""When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors"". The electors that are in the Electoral College are selected by a cer",0
"Since the car was first created there has been many innovations to different types of cars. However, studies have shown that in the last few years the percentage of people getting a license has dropped. There are many advantages in limiting car usage not only in the city but also in the suburbs.

The first of these advantages has to due with our never ending problem with our environment. For example, as stated in source number 2 the city of Paris had been very polluted. To solve this problem the ruling party in France enforced a driving ban. After five days of this driving ban being in effect the smog in Paris had gone down by 60%. because of this ban the city of Paris is a cleaner place to live now and another result of this ban is that people truly can see how much pollution these cars create.

"Automobiles have proved to be very convenient to our modern day society. It allows people to travel 20 miles in ten to fifteen minutes. By foot, it would take about four hours to travel that distance. Although cars have been beneficial, the limitation of car usage would outweigh the benefits of constantly relying on them. Decreasing the amount of time we spend in them would improve public transportation, improve air quality, and create less stress.

Cutting down the amount of car usage would encourage the use of public transportation. According to Source 1, the essentially carless suburban, Vanbaun, has made public transportation more accessible. Increasing the use of it would decrease the time it takes to commute from place to place. Less cars on the roads mean less traffic. In small towns, not as many people currently use the system on a regular basis. With the limiting of car usage, public transportation cou",0

"The time for the automobile is slowly passing. More and more people prefer carpooling and walking then driving a car. Why is that?

Giving up the car should be on every countries todo list.

"The Electoral College is a system that must be changed. It is a system that takes away the people's vote in a sense. As it originated from the Founding Fathers, it is as well an outdated system, that could have a drastic overhaul. The Electoral College could be thought of as ruining portions of this democracy, granting the people to vote for a president. There could be great error introduced to such a way of selecting people for such positions. Therefore, I stand vehemently on the side that the Electoral College must change, granting the people and the government a cleaner, more reliable form of election by three contentions: it removes the thought of there being an improper ratio of electoral votes to popular votes it is too easy for fraud to occur in the system and because of how irrational and unfair it is.

The first reason why the Electoral College must be changed in favor of a popular vote system is because of how there is such a margin of error introduced in its existence. The opposition may argue that a popular voting system may have equal, if not a greater chance of error, but that is very inaccurate.

To begin with, we should change to popular voting because it is fair to everyone. The people want a fair election. Presidents can be chosen wisely by the people, and candidates will be chosen fairly.

In plumber's article he says,"" thanks to the quirks of the electoral collegewon the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election"" To me, the voters who do like the electoral college pretty much just want to see that they can trust them just for the popular votes to succeed.

To begin with,the system of the electoral college does not allow the voters to vote for the president but only for a slate of electors, they are the ones who elect the president. There is always an offchance that those electors that won the statewide election would go to Congress and the opponent receives more electoral votes.

Everyone who is in the Electoral College was cast there for a reason by the popular vote. You also must know that the system has its faults. There aren't many of them but i believe that they are needed to keep the College going and allowing it to vote the right way instead of the wrong way. All in all, i do hope that you are also in favor of the electoral college and if you aren't, hopefully this letter will let your mind sway towards being in favor of it.

They don't realize that their votes can be overridden by these votes. And those, if the very few, who do get it, are opposed.

As we know the Electoral College chooses the president by having 538 electors and the winning president must have at least 270 electoral votes to claim the presidency. States get a number of electoral voters and depending on the size of the state depends how many voters that state gets, bigger states get more electoral voters and smaller states for example Rhode Island get less. The way the Electoral College is set up it seems that the menwomen running for presidency would try to get the minds of the bigger states with more electoral voters to choose them so they can reach the 270 mark. It is clear to me that we have done it this way ever since the founding fathers created it. Its time for a change, the Electoral College is out of date and n",0
"What is a normal day to you? Waking up, brushing your teeth, eating, then getting into car to go to work, right? That last object in that list, getting into your car, puts a strain on the environment, commonly known as pollution. Although the amount of strain that an individual may put on the environment is miniscule, the combined output of all cars in a city may be enough to damage your lungs! In Beijing, China, people wear masks outside to prevent inhalation of the dense smog surrounding the city. This has led to the development of the ""smart planning"" movement, in which city planners build dense suburbs in which cars are unneeded. Shops are a walk away, and your neighbor lives five minutes from your home. You may be asking ""Why do I care about this? I don't have heavy smog in my city."" Well when car use starts to increase in your city",0
"Cars, they're one of the most important means of transportation, varying from busses down to smart cars. The more cars being bought and used, the more pollution it makes. Researchers are saying that cars, their dense amount of smog being created, are damaging the Earth. Logically, it would be easier to say that limiting the amount of vehicles being used would allow for a cleaner city or town.

Limiting car usage in the past and present already shows a positive feed back upon the community. There has been cities dedicated to create a carfree city. An example would be in Vauban, Germany. There the city runs purely on no car usage and showed to be much cleaner, safer, and easier to navigate around in. It says in the first passage how the city is ""...better for walking..."" and that it is ""...more compact and more accessible to public transportation..."" In other areas, where car usage is an everyday expense, they have started to enforce driving bans to reduce pollution in the area. In Paris, they almost reached nearrecord pollution which reduced greatly ever since the ban. They limited the use of cars has clean",0
"In America, cars have been an integral part of our culture from the Model T. Ford to the Mustang cars have cemented themselves into our mindset. But currently cars are starting to cause a lot of problems to people such as: car accidents, pollution, and just leaving areas to crowdy. One of the main problems that cars globally cause is smog emission which is caused by the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions and can cause difficulty in breathing, lung cancer and rampant air pollution. However, in other parts of the world people are limiting car usage to almost banning them all out completly in certain areas in order to be more environmentally friendly and reducing air pollution. By limiting car usage in America people can benefit from less pollution, a more positive community impact and alternative vehicles in place of cars.

In North America, pollution has been a major problem for citizens in many ways. Besides power plants, the second main source of pollution are cars, as they release harmful chemicals and gases like smog which can cause congestion and when too much and inha",0
"Voting for a President is an extremely big deal and needs to be decided properly. People argue the subject that the Electoral College is unfair opposed to an election that is held by popular vote. However, I disagree. The Electoral College is a process in which the most popular vote gets decided on and goes to Congress for the approval. Voting for a president is a big deal, especially when the decision is sealed for four years. The Electoral College has had people question it due to its inncodent in 2000 but overall, it is the best voting option.

Many citizens believe that when they vote that is the final process, no other decisions need to be made, but they are wrong. When qualified citizens vote for a president they also help choose their state's electors. The Electoral College process includes the selection of electors, the vote between who should be President or Vice President and then sent to Congress. Many people argue that the process of the Electoral",0
"The electoral college has many inherent flaws that make it less desirable than a simple election by popular vote. It's only rebuttal to said flaws are weak, and provide little to no reason why the college is beneficial. So there is no real reason to have it in the first place. Popular vote stands to not only correct the errors of the electoral college, but also to refine our voting system. It would accomplish this by closer to a real democracy, and forcing the candidates to win over more people.

A democracy has long been revered as one of the best forms of government. It is more liberating than a dictatorship or monarchy in which people are governed by a higher class, which is more often than not decided by someone other than themselves. In a democracy however, people are given the ability to put who they desire in office. They have the ability to be governed by the person of their choice. This, however, is impeded upon by the electoral college. Because what it does is simply insert a middle man into an otherwise demo",0
"The electoral college was a great attempt to give a reliable system of selecting the president, but it just does not work the way our founding fathers wanted it to. Many people throughout the country have brought this up as a major issue because they also agree. The other option that people would prefer to have would be selecting the president by the popular vote, which is the smarter path. This method is more democratic, it has a smaller chance of producing unreliable results, and it encourages voters to still vote in states where there is already a predominant political party.

The electoral college is not democratic. The method of selecting people for it is generally controlled by each candidate's political party, and their responsibilities vary based on the party's wants. The people who select the candidates for the electoral college are not part of the popular population they are part of a political party. Next, when people go to vote for the president, they are not voting for the president, but actu",0

Some being Germany, France, Columbia, and the U.S.

Elisabeth Rosenthal describes a community in Germany. Each owner of a house in the neighborhood is allowed to own a car but has to pay a fee of 40,000 to receive a spot. In this neighborhood of Vauban, there is no need for a car because stores are located next to the neighborhood which is ""Placed a walk away"" and is very efficient.

"Today, many people all around the world rely too heavily on their cars. There are many great reasons that car usage should be limited. Car usage should be decreased because owning a car can be stressful, dangerous, and cars give off unwanted gas and pollution. Although cars have been used for many years, it is not too late to take action on this problem.

Many people today would agree that buying and maintaining a car is very stressful. It is very expensive to own a car, and it takes a lot of hard work to keep the car in good shape. ""I am much happier this way,"" states Heidrun Walter Rosenthal, 3. Walter states that she is much happier without a car due to all the stress that comes with owning a car. Walter also states that while she had a car, she was ""always tense,"" Rosenthal, 3. This is proba",0
"Starting with the end of World War II, cars have been a cultural hub all around the world, with businesses and even entire economies relying on the production and sale of cars and car products. However, after over sixty years of a car based global economy, the use of cars is beginning to slowly decline. With the decline of car usage, we see decreases in greenhouse gas pollution, a more relaxed living style, and the dawn of a new era of culture and economy around the globe.

Several major cities around the world have attempted to lower caruse through laws or even annual days devoted to reduced caruse. In Vauban, Germany, seventy percent of the population does not own a car, and fifty three percent of that population sold a car to move to Vauban. Vauban has condensed its suburban layout so that everything is within practical walking range for the most part. They have also discouraged caruse by making parking only available in two places, ""Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to parklarge garages at the edge of the development, where a carowner buys a space, for 40,000, a",0
"Cars are a basic need for people today we use them to go from point A to point B in the fastest way posible. But one must ask themselves ""do i really need the car?"", ""would i be better off without one?"", how do you tell people that what they have depended on for movement could be hurting them. I believe that cars should have a limited usage in cities because cars affect our efforts to reduce greenhouse gas, they cause smog to form around cities, and cause us to move through life at the fastest pace posible. A limited car usage would change the way we see the world its beauty, its adventersm, and we would be able to save the world from our destruction.

There is a community in Germany called Vauban where people have given up their cars. 70% of vaughn's families do not own cars, 57% sold their cars just to move to Vauban, ""When I had a car I was always tense, I'm much happier this way,"" media trainer and mother of two Heidrun Walter says in the artical ""In German suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"".

"Many people believe that owning and using a car or other motorized vehicles is an advantage. But is it really? Citizens might be able to get somewhere faster or not have to exert the energy to get there. But is it worth polluting the air, taking up all that space and creating traffic and frustrated citizens, and creating the mindset of a lazy, human being? Maybe instead of spending money on a car, citizens wouldn't be in as much debt, some kids might have college already paid for, and some citizens have their housing paid for. Therefor, this is making happier, stressfree, citizens.

People have consistently debated over whether or not this was a fair election process, due to the fact that the people's votes do not directly go to the president. Because of this, many people want the Electoral College to be gone, and people have attempted to abolish it in the past. The Electoral College should be abolished and the US should adopt the popular vote system as their only system because we live in a democratic",0
"A life without cars sure sounds like a great idea for saving up less pollution and have less traffic jams, right? Well, that's a true fact, facing the reality that over the past few years we've had times and times again where we've polluted our own air over the repetitive over use of cars, specially because nowadays there's way more cars being sold from car dealerships like Ford, Mercedes, chevrolet, and etc. On the contrary, there's now been a few areas and cities in a few countries where there's been a shortage of using cars or none used at all. A life without cars can indeed help out so much more in many various occasions and issues like pollution, smog, and traffic.

Carfree cities are the best ways to improve in somewhat of a way for easier transportation and reduced air pollution. For example, as said from source 1, ""In German Suburb, Life Goe",0
"In the United States, people are very busy. With school, work, and extracurricular activities in the mix of ""everything else,"" Americans rely on an efficient and preferably fast mode of transportation, and typically, their first resort is car. However, while cars are extremely convenient, they are also very dangerous to the environment. Car usage should be limited because there are many advantages, including less smog, less traffic, healthier people, and reduced air pollution.

To start off, when car usage is limited, smog and air pollution are drastically limited too. According to the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50 percent in the United States. This is a major problem in many different parts of the world, yet people still continue to always resort to cars, though they have many other options. Transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind powerplants, and the pollution that comes from it is most detrimental to the environment and ourselves. If we limit car usage, we will drastically reduce a",0
"Many places such as Vauban, Germany have given up the usage of cars. Vauban is a goring trend in europe and the United states because of the positive effects of not using cars. One of the biggest examples is polution, also the removal of cars would ultimately lead to a financial increase in our economy, lastly making this change positively effects our future.

First I would like to talk about a huge problem we face as a society today and that is green house gasses. You may not think that these are a big deal put if left unchecked they can become a huge problem. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe, and up to 50 percent in carintensive areas. This can become a huge problem ranging from acid rain to climate change. An example of what polution can do to a city is in paris they are putting a partial ban on cars because of how how bad there polution is. There was a huge smog problem because green house gasses were being trapped because of hot days and cold nights.

Also this change can have amazing effects on that areas economy. Because there will be no cars people will take the bus witch is less than paying for gas or they can w",0
"Car, bikes, walking and such are many forms of transportation. Cars are the main favorite overall. But as time continues we see that the drastic need for cars is growing smaller and smaller because we are now seeing the bigger picture limiting car usage is a bigger plus than a negative.

In Vauban,German the suburb is going ""carfree"". Rosenthal speaks about how Vauban allows cars but there are only two locations where they may park these cars. If you want to park your car you must buy a space for 40,000, and a home along with your parking space. Due to these facts 70% of Vauban families do not own a car. An advantage of this limited car usage is that people like Heidrum Walter speak about how she is much happier and less tense without her car.

Vauban is in an area that is more accessible to public transportation and closer to stores. The closeness allows people easier accessablity to buses, or walking and biking places. With everything close its easier to get to point A to B. Also reduces pollution and greenhouse gases due to the fact they aren't using cars to get to there locations.

"Dear State Senator, I think that our president's should be chosen by popular vote because they have better chances of winning and they will know how many people agree with what they are trying to do in the United States.

Such as paragraph 9 says, ""Thanks to the quirks of the electoral collegewon the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" I think that was unfair because Al Gore could of been the president but instead he was not, after all the campaigning he did to get those voters to vote for him it ended up as a waste because the voting didn't get him anywhere. If I was a president I would be highly upset because I knew I could have a big chance of losing just because of the Electoral College.

The Electoral College is a system that consists of 538 electors. Each state has a different amount of electors, granted on the size of that state's population. When the election is held, the voter votes for the electors, not the candidate directly.

The first fault one can find while examining this system is the ""winner takes all"" policy that most states have.

Limiting the use of cars would greatly help the problem of pollution in the world today.

The only thing a city like Miami is missing at night is a sky full of bright stars, which that can be done by people not driving to everywhere they go, even if it is one or two blocks away.

In a plethora amount of documents from the United States, and our constitution it states all men are created equal, when in all reality we are allowing the Electoral College have more say in who our president rather than we do. Not only does the Electoral College have more say in our President, but it allows the President to only go to states that they feel is nessisary to go to get the vote. It also gives less say to the smaller states making the people there feel there vote doesnt count, allowing them to vote for any party. If we change our voting system we can vote for our leader rather than us voting for the slate of electors, and have the most popular leader of our country be our president.

You see, not only is the Electoral College unfair, but it also creates a lie that tricks everyone into believing that our President was the one that the majority of America voted for, when that is not always the case.

First off, the fact that the number of electors for each state relies on the number of members in it's Congressional delegation is just illogical...lets say Florida has twenty because of its size, and California has fifty. if both states want to vote for someone different, then California is going to win only because of the size and population difference. So really, you aren't voting for the president...you're voting for the electors who will ",0
"Dear Senator, I strongly suggest that you keep the Electoral college because of the different benefits it has to offer. It creates more of a certain outcome. Also, it is a way to avoid runoff elections. Even though there may be some negative outcomes to this way of voting, I feel that the advantages overlook them.

The Electoral college is a good method of our voting system in the United States because it helps to develop a more certain outcome. According to the passage titled In Defense of the Electoral College:Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Richard A. Posner, it states that ""Because almost all states award electoral votes ona winnertakeall basis, even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoralvote victory in that state."" This tell that vote is plenty more certain using this method rather than to go by popular vote. With having a more precise and organized plan of voting it guarantees a more certain outcome and will prepare for problems that may occur such as ties in the election. The Electoral College is most defin",0
"Dear State Senator, This letter of argument is to emphasize why we should not keep the Electoral College and change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. There are very reasonable arguments for both claims as to if we should keep or abolish the Electoral College. Primarily, the Electoral College is the selection of electorss by popular vote to represent their supported party in the official presidential election. There is a total of 538 Electoral College electorss and it only takes the majority, 270 votes, to elect the president. It is not fair that the general population does not get an independent vote.

It is not the ordinary people who get to choose the president they want it is dependent upon which party the electors chooses. Voters don't have control over who their electorss vote for. As said in the second article, Al Gore won the popular vote in 2000 against Bush however, Gore lost the electorsal vote resulting in the loss of the presidentia",0
"Today's society is not worried about who has the nicest or fastest car, they just want to be able to get from point A to point B. That's why the amount of driving has decreased by 9 percent since 2005. This has helped the environment by reducing the amount of pollution and has made people happier and not as stressed.

As the pollution rate has continued to increase throughout the years, different countries have encouraged less driving for less pollution. For example, In Bogota, Columbia, their ""goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog."" Other places, like Paris, banned driving to ""clear the air of the global city."" This is due to ""days of nearrecord pollution."" The smog cleared after two days of no driving. Having alternative ways of transportation is a way to reduce air pollution.

Another advantage less driving is it makes people happier. H",0
"Limiting car usage has so many benefits to give us. It can even lead to saving the world. We've lived without them before so it's not the end of the world if they are gone for even just a day.

According to Source 1, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe....Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States. That is basically saying that having cars as often as we use them is harming the earth through their gas emissions. That cars are responsible for a certain percentage in the pollution.

Additionally, let us see about the few polluted cities or capitals such as Paris. They almost achieved a new record for pollution! But the way they are handling it is quite successful.

Limiting car usage is cheaper, better for the environment, and is quickly becoming the ""cool"" thing to do. America's fascination with the 1950's fords are over, and a new era is upon us.

Cutting down on car usage is much cheaper. Between the expensive vehicle itself and enormous gas bill, It's more fiscally responsible to carpool, use public transportation, or even walk. Places like Vauban in Germany are just the start of a quickly growing social trend to make cars more expensive. As stated in Source 1, ""There are only two places to parkLarge garages at the edge of the development, where a carowner buys a space, for 40,000, along with a home"". Places like Paris have even been known to enact partial driving bans at times, with 22euro fines enacted for those who failed to follow the ban. Driving, an already expensive task, is increasingly becoming a task only the rich can afford.

I am writing to you because it is in our best interest to abolish the Electoral College and change election to popular vote for the next presidential election. The reasons we should make this change is because the Electoral College is unfair for voters, also a disaster waiting to happen and the popular voting system bring so many more benefits and opportunities for the people.

The Electoral system simply takes away the people's say on who they think the best candidate is. It is simply unfair for the voters. In this system, according to the second source, popular vote, which is what the majority people select, most of the time loses the election due to the Electoral System.

But others understand that we should change the voting system so that the election is more fair. I believe that the United States should no longer use the Electoral College to elect our president because I feel that we should have a more direct vote so that the person that most people actually want in office will be elected and so that all of the states can hear each candidates campaign so they feel like their vote actually takes part in the election.

To begin with, I believe that the United States should start to use a direct vote to choose our leader so that the winner of the popular vote actually gets to win and so that the peoples votes actually matter. It seems only fair that if you win the popular vote from everyone one in the country that you should win the race but with using the Electoral College the decision will always vary.

"Many people argue over the fact that the Electoral College is beneficial or not. I'm writing this letter to you Mr. Senator to explain the good and bad effects the Electoral College has. The Electoral College is a process, it is a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The Electoral College keeps the elections balanced, it keeps the elections organized. It may have some bad effects. For example, many argue that the people's votes aren't what choose the president.

The Electoral College maintains the elections balanced, ""It avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of vote cast."" as stated in the article by Richard Posner. It balances the votes by a larger state compared to a smaller state.

"The debate on the pros and cons of car usage has been an ongoing one. Slowly, the advantages are beginning to outweigh the disadvantages. Around the world, projects and programs have been started to test the effects of limited car use. Data has proved that limiting car usage will cause less pollution, less stress, and less traffic.

To begin with, gas released from our cars has slowly started to hurt us. ""After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.""source 2. This shows that the gas in our cars is one of the factors responsible for the growing pollution in our air. Reducing the usage of cars will not only benefit us, but also the world we live in.

However, if there is a way to keep it, we can use it if there is a tie between the Presidency voting.

To begin with, with limited car usage there will be less pollution and less stress. Most of our pollution comes from cars, the smoke that the engine of the car lets out causes it.

However, there has been ways that people are trying to lower these gasses. People around the world are reducing the use of cars for a more cleaner form of transportation. In Vauban, Germany residents in this community ""have given up their cars""1. Also in Paris where they ""enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air""10. While in Bogota, Colombia they have a car free day to ""promote alternative transportation and reduce smog""20. These cities are pioneers in the way of a cleaner form of travel.

The first step is to just have a day without cars, like a new holiday. In Bogota, thats just what they have. On this day ""millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work""20, and those who didn't were fined. This reduces not only smog but the stress of driving and the business of traffic jams. On one of these carfree days, even though it was rainin",0

The founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between elections of the President by a vote in congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

Voting by Electoral College is not safe at all,they should change it to election by popular vote for the President of the United States. When you vote by electoral vote it is never guaranteed that they are going to vote for who you wanted to vote for. They might even change their mind at the last second ,so you never know what they are about to do. Some rich people can pay them to buy off their votes.

When we limit our car use it saves the earth also it i said that it takes away a heap load of stress and it saves people money. Just think about it, one day without the use of cars. How would that be?

We we think of saving the earth we think of recycling, reusing things, and reducing. Did you know that passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gases and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States.According to ""In German suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" By: Elisabeth Rosenthal.

"I have spent most of my living not far from the beach, in Savannah, Georgia on the East Coast of the USA. I love the beach…I go to the beach for the warmth of the sun, and to absorb Vitamin D, and I go there for the peace and to enjoy nature, basically. It's a thing my family has always done during the summer, throughout my life

What I love most about going to the beach, is the feeling I get, that I get nowhere else in the world. When you look at the ocean, and see the horizon, water is as far as the eye can see. You can see no land beyond the horizon, and it makes me aware of how small I am in the grand scheme of things. It is huge and overwhelmingly vast and I have this actual, perceptual, feeling of being very tiny. But this gives me peace. For me, when I'm at the beach, I'm reminded that there is, indeed, a creator, and that I'm part of something bigger. It is too beautiful and perfect to be a scientific “accident.” I think of the tides and the moon and gravitational forces, and how amazing it all is. I'm reminded that I'm not alone and that someone else is in control, and it's the most peaceful feeling. There is no fear or negativity at the beach, only fresh air",1
"and…contentment. The sky is the limit!

It is peaceful and tranquil. There are parts of the beach where no one is around. You can lie in the sand and close your eyes and you can hear the waves crashing. It's a melodic and rhythmic sound, like “the music of life.” The sun is warm and bright, and piercing you with energy, while the wind blows over your body like a breezy blanket. You hear the seagulls squack as they soar overhead, and you can taste the salt in the air. It's a symphony of waves, wind, sun, sand, and salt.

I am lucky to have an area of the beach, on the South end, where a large sandbar surfaces that causes tide pools to form at the shoreline. So, you can lie on a raft or just float in the tide pool, but you won't drift out to sea because you are partly anchored in the sand. The last time I did that, it was the best sleep I've ever gotten.

It is just the most relaxing experience you can have. Then you can search for, and find, beautiful shells and sharks' teeth. You can build sand castles and ride the waves on boogy boards. You can surf or paddle board, ride a jet ski.

Whether you want to relax or be very active, there are many reasons to go to the beach.

The main",1
"purpose to go to the beach is just to feel the nothingness. It helps me to shut down all extreme emotions such as sadness, happiness, excitement, anxiety. You must sit back and just observe the waves, count the high tide frequency without efforts, close your eyes and feel the wind against your skin which will give you sense of relaxation. Observe the innocent kids playing in the water and the sand, roll back to your childhood memories when our parents didn't let us go play in the water. Observe the loners at the beach, trying to do the same thing that you are doing. Just feel the beauty of the nature and enjoy the feel of it. Once you are done, listen to some calm music and croon along and get lost in the world of peace
Well, a lot of lames in Florida where I currently live will probably disagree with this, because most of them just go and lay out on the sand. I’m not entirely sure what the purpose of that is. Maybe relaxation.

My San Diegans will probably agree with my notion though… The purpose of going to the beach is to get fully rejuvenated and invigorated. When you go in that water (especially if it’s cold and full of waves, but anywhere!), your soul feels completely",1
"elevated afterwards. It washes out any mediocrity in your life and picks you right back up. It is to soothe your soul, to make you feel gratitude, to help you interact more positively with strangers, you name it.
I'm a Japanese student. I'm studying English for going abroad next year. I'm sorry I will write poor sentences.

I think that there are several reasons why people like beaches. Beaches are one of the best places where people can relax and refresh. It's not only a sport to swimming or surfing. People can do many things such as getting suntan, watching sunset, taking pictures. Moreover, a lot of sounds that people are hearing everyday is not comfortable. People need to hear the sound of beaches for stress relief. The sound of beaches have effect of comfortable and healing. It's very sooth and calm which gives people a feeling of freedom. In addition, the blue color of the sea has effect of calming their feeling and stabilizing their mind. I think that closing their eyes, feeling warm sun on their skin and hearing the sound of waves or watching the sunset and hearing the sound of waves are so heal. If you feel tired or irritated, you should go to beaches.People feel that",1
"beaches are the best place for healing , but in some cases disasters such as Tunami has a bad influence on people.
Over the years, I have met many people who love to lie on a beach for their vacation.

I have neighbors who are sun lovers, in that whenever the sun is shining, they are out in their driveway soaking in the sun. Amazingly, everywhere I have lived there has always been at least one person/family who was like this. So for them, a beach vacation makes a lot of sense.

For others, a beach vacation is one part of a party vacation. They can lie on the beach during the day and then go partying through the night. When they wake up with a hangover, all they have to do is make it to the beach to rest off their condition.

For others, it is an affordable vacation where the children can play in the sand and splash in the water for no extra charge. Also, for people who use vacations to relax and recharge, they can sit on the beach, in the sun, rest and read a book.

And, not all of the people who are at the beach are completely on beach vacations. I have spent one or two days of a 3 week trip at a beach. Also, people can head out on the water for fishing or going to an island for",1
"hiking, scuba diving or snorkling or many other aquatic related activities. This is very much like a hiking vacation, just on water.

So there are many reasons that people take beach vacations. They are fun.
Running on the beach challenges your body in a different way than running on solid ground. If you want your training to be effective, you should be aware of the benefits and risks.

What are the benefits of running on the beach?

Requires more energy. Running on the sand provides added resistance for the large lower body muscles, requiring more effort and energy to propel your body forward.
Provides a softer landing.
Strengthens the smaller muscles.
Improves athletic performance.
Challenges the core.
Improved your training technique
Building your strength, muscle stability and coordination
Increases your calorie burn and gives you the most value for your time
Ancient medicine advocated that individuals with healing fractures must exercise on hot beach sand to speed up the healing process. By running on hot sand, all the muscles get stretched and activated proving beneficial to strengthening the muscle groups in the foot.

DON’T OVERDO IT!
Running on the beach may put more",1
"strain on your muscles and joints. The ideal surface to run on is a relatively flat, smooth, resilient and reasonably soft track or jogging trail. Runners can suffer from lower extremity joint damage if they run on uneven sand. Switch up between sand and track and you will start to see incredible results
I can't really answer for everyone, but I can tell you why I love to vacation at the beach.

I live inland. There's something about the air, the sound of the surf, the sand between my toes that just feels like…ahhhhh!

Everything about the beach just seems to soothe my soul. I'm away from my everyday life and all its stresses and demands. It feels like freedom. I can play in the water, beachcomb for shells and driftwood, or just sit and watch the waves. When I go back home, I feel absolutely refreshed. If I start being cranky for no apparent reason, boyfriend always asks me if I'm overdue for a beach day!

I think part of the allure of beaches is the typical depictions of paradise in movies and literature, not to mention the travel brochures. Almost always involving a remote island beach, with lush vegetation, breathtaking sunrises and sunsets, exotic foods…and who doesn't want to",1

Because women’s attraction IS more complex.

Here’s why:

Evolutionarily speaking, all a male needs to do is impregnate. There’s basically no cost, risk, or consequences to spooging in a woman. Once she’s pregnant he could just leave and consider himself an evolutionary success…his genetic line has been replicated. Mission accomplished.

Evolutionarily speaking, females have to do a LOT more. They have to carry the gestating embryo. Then they have to give birth. Then they have feed the baby. And raise the baby. And protect the baby.

ALL these things are EXTREMELY costly and risky and the consequences last for YEARS, therefore a female needs to be VERY picky about who she chooses to mate with.

Her partner not only has to have good genes so the kids will be healthy, he also has to have good character so he’ll (hopefully) stick around help take care of her and the baby. And he has to be strong and competent enough to protect her and the baby.

For men, the whole thing can start and stop with good looks.

For women, good looks are only part of it, and evolution has shaped female attraction instincts to account for this.

Female attraction IS more complex than",1
"men’s.
You’re playing word games.

A man who can not attract all women is, by definition, not attractive to all women. (There’s no man on Earth who is attractive to all women, since women have a huge variety of tastes. Even men, such as George Clooney, who are attractive to many women are not attractive to all women. And some women aren’t attracted to men at all.)

A man who is attractive to many women is capable of attracting many women. A man who is attractive to a few women is capable of attracting a few women. I’m not really sure what you’re question is saying, besides the obvious fact that some men are capable of attracting more women than others.

You seem to want to associate that with some sort of rank or judgement, e.g. “A man capable of attracting many women is more _________ than a man capable of attracting just a few women.”

What is in that blank? It’s not helpful to fill it with words like “attractive,” “appealing,” or “sexy,” because you wind up with a tautology. Yes, of course, a man who is attractive to more women is attractive/appealing/sexy to those women he attracts. Women who are attracted to George Clooney are … attracted to George Clooney.

And … ?

If you",1
"fill the blank with words like “better” (while getting rid of the preceding “more,” so as to keep the sentence grammatically correct) or phrases like “more of a man,” you’re just choosing to define a “better man” as “someone who is attractive to lots of women.” Again, that tells us nothing, except perhaps giving us a little information about your biases.

In the end, we’re left with the simple, boring fact that some men attract more women than others. Which we already know. Are these more-attractive-men stronger, smarter, better at driving, more capably at mathematics, funnier, better at photography, etc. than the less-attractive men? No. There’s no correlation.

Is a “less attractive man” less attractive to the specific women who are attracted to him? No. That would be a contradiction. They’re attractive to the women who are attracted to them and not attractive to the women who aren’t.

Do some people think of men-who-can-attract-lots-of-women as somehow better (aside from their ability to attract lots of women) than men who attract fewer women. Yes. Some people feel that way. Some people don’t. Some people feel the opposite way. Some have biases against attractive men, assuming",1
"they’re stupid or boring. Different people have different biases.
Not so. The more beautiful a woman is the more she will be desired by men could be true, but loved? That is a totally different thing. Look at Marilyn Monroe, a more beautiful woman you cannot find. She might have been loved by some men, but most men were infatuated, obsessed, in lust with…. and this brought her a lot of pain and heartbreak. Men often used her, mistreated her, took from her, wanted to own her, wanted to control and keep her or leave her alone after taking. Few men, even the ones who married her were able to really love and care for her. She had a hard time loving herself and had a hard time receiving love even when it came sincerely. No, beauty plays no role in true love. When someone “falls in love” with a beautiful woman they are falling in love with the beauty itself, not the woman. Look across the globe and see how this love fades as fast beauty itself fades. Men who stay with women into old age are so rare that we attempt to capture it and post it on Instagram whenever we find it. Beautiful women know this better than anyone, it is why so many of them are so insecure. Beauty is a distraction",1
"and can confuse a lot of people for a lot of time, don’t get caught up in the illusion that keeps you from doubting your own self worth. Love is out there, but it isn’t where you think it is.
I think (very) young women are not aware of this right away, but as they gain life experience, they start to realize it (at first it flatters them), and then some start to use it as a tool.

Experienced women have often learned how to wear this very well.

I think it messes up the minds of some women, who might be aesthetically attractive from a young age. At first they don’t understand the nature of the new attention. Some may allow themselves to be taken advantage of because they are not yet equipped to handle it. But as they gain knowledge and experience, some of these women may have their entire view of male-female relationships skewed by this.

One lady friend I knew long ago was such a woman. She was very modelesque from a young age and as such, eventually came to the conclusion that she only needed to date men that approached her. That was effective for her since it always happened. So there was one fellow I knew that she liked a lot, and she assumed he was not interested in her",1
"because he never approached her. But since I was friends with both of them, I happened to know he idolized her, but felt she was unapproachable because of her good looks.

Wow, that was an exercise in frustration to watch these two NOT ask each other out.

He was afraid to ask HER out because of her good looks. She was afraid to ask HIM out because she was conditioned (by her life experience) to think that men will ask you out if they are interested in you, and won’t if they are NOT.
My family has always been on intimate terms with medical error. My brother lived with myotonic dystrophy for two decades before anyone gave it a name. My twin sister, by luck, was diagnosed sooner by a visiting locum. Before that, she was handed a grab bag of incorrect labels by her doctors: depressed, tired like everyone else, or simply suffering from ‘wear and tear’. It seemed she was offered anything but the truth, including candour from the physicians who didn’t know. Luck, in medicine, can also be oddly cruel. My late partner’s stomach cancer was discovered only after years of missed signals about his congenital heart condition. By the time doctors recognised the heart problem, they discovered",1
"his cancer had already taken root.

For me, these are not abstract stories about system failure – they are family history. But they are also part of a wider, more astonishing reality: medical error is among the leading causes of death worldwide. In the US, it is estimated that around 800,000 people die or become permanently disabled each year from diagnostic error alone.

At this point, many argue that the solution lies with technology. If errors are inevitable in human hands, perhaps machines can steady them, or even replace them altogether. Enter Dr Bot. Depending on who you ask, the machine is either a saviour or a saboteur. Most commonly, the vision is one of man and machine working side by side: the algorithm whispering in the doctor’s ear, the human hand guiding the treatment. A doctorly duet, not a duel.

Doctors are enmeshed in the very system under scrutiny. Of course they want to believe they’re irreplaceable

If the purpose of medicine is patient care, then the real question is not who holds the stethoscope, but who – or what – can best deliver safe, reliable and equitable outcomes.

But you will not find in this essay a roll call of AI’s latest feats or a tally of its",1
"diagnostic wins and losses. Instead, I want to examine a prior assumption: that doctors themselves must be the arbiters of whether technology can replace them, or even that doctors should be central to the conversation at all. Instead, in the spirit of philosophical enquiry, with as big a question as who or what should deliver patient care, we need to demonstrate parity and fairness. We rightly scrutinise Big Tech and suspect its motives and methods, but medicine is no less conflicted. To presume that doctors should arbitrate their own indispensability is to let the most interested party preside as judge and jury.

In this essay, then, I turn the lens not on AI itself, but on the presupposition that physicians ought to be the ones deciding whether Dr Bot can – or should – take their place. It is such a common assumption that it tends to move camouflaged within our conversations about the future of clinics.

Doctors are enmeshed in the very system under scrutiny. Their status, salaries and sense of self are bound up in the debate. Of course they want to believe they’re irreplaceable. But history shows that those most invested in their own survival are rarely the best judges of",1
"their own irreplaceability. If we are to think clearly about whether Dr Bot could replace, or even work alongside, human doctors, we must step outside the consulting room and confront the question on its own terms – with as few allegiances as possible.

An outsider’s vantage point, in other words, is essential. Independent observers can notice what insiders either miss or quietly refuse to acknowledge. That means drawing on a range of perspectives: philosophy, sociology, psychology, and patients themselves – all of whom may be better placed to ask what medicine is for, how well it works, and who or what can serve its purpose best.

In that spirit, I want to open a conversation about the past and future of medicine.

Take prognosis and treatment, where a psychological spotlight on doctors’ performance is revealing. Doctors must act with conviction; hesitation can cost lives. Here, unlike philosophers who can hedge with ‘on the one hand’ and ‘on the other’, clinicians are forced into swift, high-stakes decisions. Confidence, even overconfidence, is baked into the role. The problem is that confidence is no guarantee of accuracy. One study of intensive-care patients found that doctors",1
"who were ‘completely certain’ of their diagnosis were wrong as much as 40 per cent of the time. Worse still, as experience and familiarity with making clinical judgments increase, doctors tend to consult colleagues less and seek fewer second opinions. Authority can curdle into overconfidence – which can seem like arrogance.

Patients, paradoxically, collude in this. We prefer doctors who project confidence, even if misplaced. The white coat is still treated as a symbol of authority; we are reassured by decisiveness, even when it is wrong. But conviction, as decades of studies show, is an unreliable proxy for accuracy. As one pathologist put it, physicians are ‘walking around in a fog of misplaced optimism’.

For centuries, we have lived under the myth of the irreplaceable doctor. Physicians are not only healers but cultural icons: secular priests of the body, guardians of mortality, and interpreters of suffering. We look to them not simply for treatment but for reassurance, ritual, even a touch of transcendence. Yet this mythology clouds judgment. When we insist that ‘only a human’ can offer care, what we often mean is that we cannot imagine a different arrangement. But history is",1
"full of occupations and roles once thought untouchable – clerics, navigators, even bank tellers – that were eventually dethroned in different domains and guises.

Surgeons once opposed anaesthesia because they feared it would erode their hard-won skill in operating quickly

Then there is symptom denial – not among patients, but in the profession itself. The French Enlightenment philosopher Voltaire mocked his character Dr Pangloss, tutor to the young Candide, who insisted that ‘all is for the best’ in the ‘best of all possible worlds’, no matter how dire reality appeared. Medicine has often adopted its own Panglossian stance, downplaying or deflecting recognition of its failures. Diagnostic error, for example, was largely ignored for most of medical history. When the Institute of Medicine published its landmark report To Err Is Human (1999), the index of the 270-page document included only two references to diagnostic error. When patient safety researchers such as David Newman-Toker and Peter Pronovost began highlighting misdiagnosis as a crisis in the 2000s, they encountered institutional indifference and professional resistance.

Doctors’ instinct to minimise their errors is",1
"understandable but revealing. Studies show that, when confronted with data on mistakes, physicians are more likely than patients to dismiss the numbers as exaggerated, or to suggest that errors happen to ‘other doctors’. Surgeons, for example, consistently underestimate their own complication rates. What looks like denial is, in fact, a protective shield for professional identity and perhaps for the capacity to continue to practise. Perhaps too much humility might even be crushing when it comes to keeping going in medicine. Doctors often tell me their mistakes haunt them. The harder truth is that many errors pass unnoticed, and unacknowledged.

History shows that this defensiveness also extends to innovation. Medicine has repeatedly resisted insights that challenge existing theories and practices. Anaesthesia, antiseptics, vaccines – even handwashing was initially met with disdain. Surgeons once opposed anaesthesia because they feared it would erode their hard-won skill in operating quickly – even though patients writhed in agony. As the historian David Wootton wrote in the book Bad Medicine: Doctors Doing Harm Since Hippocrates (2007), medicine’s reluctance to engage with novel",1
"advances has often slowed progress. More recently, doctors resisted basic digital tools such as online portals for patients to access their own records. As late as 2021, most US providers were still using fax machines to share clinical information. In the UK, the National Health Service still spends millions each year on stamps and paper.

Conservatism in medicine is not always a vice. The philosopher Thomas Kuhn, in his book The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962), argued that scientific communities need to defend their paradigms until the evidence for change is overwhelming. Otherwise, every fad would destabilise the field. But medicine’s caution often goes beyond prudence. Change is resisted not only because of the burden of work – a challenge that it would be unfair not to fully acknowledge – but also because it is easier and sometimes protects professional interests.

Consider how fiercely medicine guards its monopoly. In the US, nurse practitioners and physician associates are legally capable of handling up to 90 per cent of what primary care doctors currently do. Studies show patients cared for by nurse practitioners often report equal or greater satisfaction. Yet",1
"physician groups consistently lobby to limit their autonomy. The American Medical Association spends tens of millions each year to preserve physicians’ dominance, outspending many Silicon Valley giants. In the UK, the British Medical Association continues to campaign against expanding the role of physician associates, warning that they threaten the ‘unique role’ of the doctor. Meanwhile, millions of patients go without any kind of timely care.

This guild mentality also shows up in attitudes toward transparency. Patients now have legal rights to access their medical records, but when authorities in the US and the UK tried to make online access routine, professional bodies resisted. Doctors warned of patient anxiety, confusion or wasted appointments – objections that largely failed to materialise. What online access did reveal, however, was something more awkward: one in five patients reported finding errors in their records, some of them serious. No wonder access was so fiercely opposed.

Of course, none of this means doctors are villains. Even pushback with records is understandable from doctors worried that they would be inundated with enquiries and extra work. It is worth",1
"remembering that the vast majority are dedicated, brilliant and deeply humane. But, as a profession, it is also crucial to challenge self-interested practices.

Part of medicine’s influence rests on what the scholars Richard and Daniel Susskind have called the ‘grand bargain’ of the professions. In their book The Future of the Professions: How Technology Will Transform the Work of Human Experts (2022), they argue that society grants white-collar workers prestige, status and generous remuneration in exchange for the promise of expertise and ethical conduct. Doctors enjoy a monopoly on diagnosis and treatment, controlling entry into the profession through licensing and regulation. In return, the public trusts them to act in patients’ best interests. Indeed, doctors are among the world’s most trusted professionals – well above journalists, politicians and religious clerics. But the bargain is not always honoured. The privileges are obvious – high salaries, cultural prestige and political clout. The obligations, less so. When professional bodies resist patient access to records, block the autonomy of nurse practitioners, or deny the scale of diagnostic error, they are protecting the",1
"guild rather than the public.

None of this is to deny that medicine is often meaningful work, or that many doctors see their role as a calling. But career satisfaction, prestige or pay are not arguments for preserving a profession. Most of us do not enjoy our work. Therefore, the privileges of physicians, or special pleading based on meaningfulness, is an argument that must be independently investigated. Again, we must underline in bold, red ink: the central question must be whether the current arrangement delivers reliable, accessible care – and, if it does not, whether new models, including AI, might do better.

If Dr Bot is to have a role, it will not be as an imitation priest in a white coat

Before we even get to the evidence on whether Dr Bot or human doctors perform better – or whether some hybrid arrangement might work best – many doctors bristle. As a health informaticist (an empirical researcher specialising in the data on healthcare), I have surveyed doctors on this question for years, across multiple countries, and can attest that their defence is almost always the same. AI lacks what they call judgment. It has no intuition, no hunches, no instinct or presentiment, no",1
"feel for the patient. This perspective was encapsulated by the anaesthetist Ronald Dworkin who wrote:

Because AI lacks intuition, suspicion, instinct, presentiment and feeling, it lacks judgment in the human sense. It can only work with abstractions – that is, with words. It can never get behind the words. It can never get deep inside matters.
Richard Susskind has steadfastly argued that we tend to elevate human judgment as if it were intrinsically valuable, rather than asking a more basic question: what are the problems to which human judgment is the solution? If accurate diagnosis is the problem, it is unclear whether human judgment – namely that of doctors – must be the only solution. Here, Susskind argues, we must carefully distinguish between processes and outcomes. In medicine, the profession often preserves its processes – the rituals of consultation, the authority of the bedside manner, the art of medicine – rather than focusing on outcomes.

But this is a classic case of process-thinking. The argument preserves the mystique of how decisions are made, rather than asking the only question that matters: what outcomes do those decisions produce for patients? A person",1
"arriving in the emergency department with crushing chest pain does not care whether the diagnosis comes from human intuition or from an algorithm; they care only that it is correct, delivered quickly, and followed by the right treatment. As Susskind puts it in his most recent book How to Think About AI: A Guide for the Perplexed (2025): ‘People who seek expert help do not generally approach their professional advisers saying, “Good morning, I would like some judgment please.” Judgment isn’t the end in itself.’ As Susskind urges, people want peace of mind, not necessarily therapists; they want health and access to accurate information, not necessarily medical appointments.

Of course, the picture is a little messier. Many of us have grown attached to familiar processes – the ritual of the waiting room, the authority of the white coat, the reassuring cadence of a consultation. But some of this is mere habit, not preference: we accept these rituals because they are what we have always known. Patients may enjoy the familiarity, but in the end – when it is a matter of diagnoses delayed or missed – they care less about whether wisdom is dispensed through a kindly doctor or a computer",1
"interface, than about whether they receive an accurate diagnosis, effective treatment and humane care.

What matters is not sentiment but whether care can be made more accurate, more timely and more humane

These questions, then, are not about abstract principles or clever thought experiments only. They cut through the texture of real lives – my family’s included – and they expose the fault lines of medicine itself. Doctors are fallible not simply because they are tired, or overworked, or badly resourced, but because they are human: bound by psychology, shaped by habits, and protected by institutions that defend their own interests. Technology will not save us if it simply reproduces medicine’s old flaws in digital form. Every innovation arrives with its own complications, even as it solves others. That is no reason to shut down progress, or to rig the terms of debate in advance. AI carries serious ethical and political risks – from deepening inequalities to new forms of harm, from lost jobs to environmental costs. These concerns deserve scrutiny. But what will not help is straw-manning the technology, or deferring endlessly to the very profession whose survival is at stake.",1
"Doctors cannot be the only ones asked to judge their own replaceability.

And so, to the present question: the very possibility of a Dr Bot. What matters is not sentiment but whether care can be made more accurate, more timely and more humane. I know what turns on that question: years lost to misdiagnosis, treatments delayed, conditions overlooked until it was too late. It is natural that doctors defend their intuition, hard-won through gruelling training. But that defence is made from rarefied air, far above the lived reality of the patients medicine fails. My siblings endured years of self-doubt while wrong diagnoses passed as routine. Such omissions, biases and errors are not abstractions, as physicians may wish them to be. They are real harms, far too often unseen.

If Dr Bot is to have a role, it will not be as an imitation priest in a white coat, but as part of a wider reckoning with what medicine is for and who it should serve. The point is not to preserve a profession but to reimagine a practice.

In that light, the really pressing question is not whether AI can replace doctors. The evidence for or against that will emerge soon, as it should. What matters first is whether",1
"we are willing to release ourselves from the myths that keep medicine tethered to its own limitations. Only then can we begin to imagine and properly question whether new systems and processes could serve patients better than the ones we have now. andeville thought of himself as a reader of disguised human motives, an anatomist of human nature, ready to show people what they are, rather than what they should be. He would accomplish this by keenly analysing human behaviours and institutions in terms of their motivating passions. From thoughtful observation and personal experience of these passions, he attempted to draw general principles about human nature, principles that would stand in analogy to the laws that govern the natural world. For these very reasons, David Hume listed him as one of those who had begun to place that ‘science of man’ on firm ground, along with John Locke, Lord Shaftesbury, Joseph Butler and Francis Hutcheson.

"London

Mandeville was well prepared for this task. Born in Rotterdam in 1670, he later graduated in medicine and philosophy from the University of Leiden, and trained as a medical physician, before settling in London. There he practised as a specialist in hypochondria and nervous disorders, meeting his patients for long sessions of therapeutic dialogues in his private quarters (not dissimilar to the later practice of psychoanalysis, in fact). This experience produced his Treatise of the Hypochondriac and Hysteric Passions (1711, 1730).

In Mandeville’s view, human beings are driven by their self-regarding passions. We are always feeding them, even when they act contrary to self-interest – we feed them to the point of deceiving ourselves about our own motivations. Among the passions, the predominant force is pride:

that natural faculty by which every mortal that has any understanding over-values, and imagines better things of himself than any impartial judge, thoroughly acquainted with all his qualities and circumstances, could allow him. We are possessed of no other quality so beneficial to society, and so necessary to render it wealthy and flourishing …
Pride, like other",1
"self-centered passions, is necessary for the flourishing of society, and Mandeville identifies in the self-regarding nature of human individuals the original, natural disposition to sociability. The very human capability to socialise is grounded in the operations of pride and the fear of shame, which together Mandeville calls the passion of ‘self-liking’. These are the sentiments in which we overvalue ourselves, and which constantly rely on other people to be confirmed, reassured and gratified. Our pride requires the company of others; our pride creates the need to socialise, to form society.

The history of sociability is a continuous process of modifying codes and expressions of deference

For Mandeville, sociability is the result of an evolutionary process. He characterised it as the outcome of a gradual, spontaneous progression, achieved not by the defeat of self-regarding passions but by their domestication into forms compatible with social cohesion and civic growth. Along with a high opinion of themselves, individuals have a profound desire for others to share in that opinion. But human pride is always accompanied by the secret apprehension that the value we place on",1
"ourselves is not entirely justified. The natural symptoms of the high self-esteem that human beings display and experience in their fellows are mutually offending, to the point of prompting individuals to conceal the enormity of their self-regard. We learn to take pride in hiding our pride.

The different forms of reciprocal adulation therefore have as their motivating force the constant need of human nature to experience and express self-liking. And this holds throughout the history of civilisation. The history of sociability is a continuous process of modifying codes and expressions of deference. It is ‘no more’, he writes, ‘than the various methods of making ourselves acceptable to others, with as little prejudice to ourselves as is possible …’

Since the desire for praise is a universal property of human nature – central to Mandeville’s philosophical anthropology – a theory of sociability requires a sociohistorical account in order to show how self-regard assumes different shapes in different historical contexts. The acts and words that are publicly praised or blamed in one age differ from another; codes of honour and shame almost always vary between cultures. Mandeville’s",1
"focus on the manners and habits of his contemporaries is thus a fundamental feature of his philosophical anthropology.

In early 18th-century Britain, the language of manners and its key term ‘politeness’ had become a crucial model for honourable behaviour, and a new way to formulate the ideal of respectability. By tracing the history of contemporary male and female codes of honourable behaviour from the perspective of his theory of passion, Mandeville denounces the moral hypocrisy of the overly confident and fashionably well-bred, who deluded themselves into believing that their good manners are equivalent to virtuous conduct. He shows that the rituals of politeness and honour are an exemplary expression of a spontaneous and artificial order resulting from a natural disposition of the human passions and the perennial need to be liked. The great and the good were no better than the bees; the only difference was that they happened to wear periwigs and fontanges.

In Mandeville’s first prose works, he assumed a female persona, and in all his writings he maintained a keen interest in the life of women and the ‘double standard’ applied to them in education, social status and the",1
"satisfaction of sexual desire. In The Virgin Unmasked: Or, Female Dialogues Betwixt an Elderly Maiden Lady and Her Niece (1709), an experienced woman warns her niece about how men seduce and enslave women, in stark contrast to the rose-tinted image of love found in popular tales of romance. They discuss gender education in a male-dominated world, where women are subjected to their fathers’ and husbands’ control. This oppression not only undermines women’s character but also condemns them to a diminished social role, which further exposes them to men’s manipulations by making them vulnerable to nefarious tricks and traps.

Mandeville’s ‘science of man’ took seriously the position of women in a deeply misogynistic society. He continued his examination of gender in a series of essays in the periodical The Female Tatler, published a year later. Two sister journalists vindicate women’s right to a social and cultural role: men have excluded women from education and from writing history, from reading and of being read in books, thus maintaining male domination by handing down a culture in which women’s fate is submission, their most precious quality is meekness, and their public",1
"reputation for virtue is based solely on chastity.

In 1711, the periodical The Spectator bluntly summarised this double standard of male and female honour:

The great point of honour in men is courage, and in women chastity. If a man loses his honour in one rencounter, it is not impossible for him to regain it in another; a slip in a woman’s honour is irrecoverable.
Chastity, then, is essentially synonymous with passivity, with avoiding dishonour; the opposite of the activity that constituted male honour. Female virtue is not only determined exclusively by the relationship with the opposite sex, but is presented as essential to female nature. While men had the opportunity to act courageously and regain their tarnished honour, women had to be chaste – or not. Once lost, their honour cannot be recovered.

The duel is a paradigmatic expression of the function of pride and shame in the development of sociability

The first decades of the 18th century, during which Mandeville wrote and published his major works, were the golden age for duelling in Britain. Challenging someone to a duel and behaving politely to an individual before attempting to kill him was a custom of enormous social",1
"significance. Due to its paradoxical conceptual framework – where courage and warlike virtues are associated with the ruling classes, and those latter with noble birth and moral sensibility – participating in this highly ritualised form of attempted homicide-suicide was considered the best way to acquire a reputation of respectability and even virtue. The willingness to duel remained an eccentric but fundamental feature of gentlemanliness. However, duels were forbidden by almost all European legislations and condemned as a mortal sin – it was seen as a preposterous waste of noble or gentlemanly blood.

Mandeville intervened in the debate on duelling in almost all his writings. With the provocative attitude characteristic of his style, he used traditional arguments from courtesy literature to advance a defence of duelling as a useful deterrent for those who might break social norms. But Mandeville also makes the duel a paradigmatic expression of the function of pride and shame in the development of sociability. Duelling, which testifies to the prevalence of the fear of shame over the fear of death, represents for Mandeville the most extreme expression of a fundamental feature of",1
"human nature, one that stands at the very roots of sociability: the tendency to strive for social recognition, acting in accordance with an idealised self-image to satisfy the desire for pride and the fear of shame, absorbed in a practice of self- (and mutual) deception. ‘The same passion that makes the well-bred man, and prudent officer, value and secretly admire themselves for the honour and fidelity they display,’ he writes, ‘may make the rake and scoundrel brag of their vices and boast of their impudence.’

In the second part of the Fable of the Bees, Mandeville further anatomises human nature through a cutting analysis of the ‘polite gentleman’. The decisive test is to examine this gentleman’s attitude when faced with the challenge to a duel. It cannot be denied that duelling is a mortal sin for the gentleman, but shirking it is out of the question:

Entirely to quit the world, and at once to renounce the conversation of all persons that are valuable in it, is a terrible thing to resolve upon. Would you become a town and table-talk? Could you submit to be the jest and scorn of public-houses, stage-coaches, and market-places? Is not this the certain fate of a man, who should",1
"refuse to fight, or bear an affront without resentment?
Duellists may deceive themselves with the rhetoric of honour, but they are in fact motivated exclusively by pride and shame. The inner conflict faced by a man challenged to a duel is not about his supposed ‘sense of honour’ or his religious principles, but about the two basic passions that rule human nature: self-love (the instinct of self-preservation) and self-liking (the love of praise, the fear of shame). In Mandeville’s final diagnosis: ‘Vanity, shame, and … constitution, make up very often the courage of men and virtue of women.’

Even if the good and evil of honour and dishonour are illusory, shame is very real, with its own psychological and physiological symptoms. Mandeville described them in detail: ‘though shame is a real passion, the evil to be feared from it is altogether imaginary, and has no existence but in our own reflection on the opinion of others.’ He sees the taming of the natural impulses of lust through the education of shame as a paradigmatic example of how passions in society are restrained and modified. In Mandeville’s time, human beings were so successfully trained to feel shame that the distinction",1
"between lustful men and chaste women appeared to be an entirely natural difference rather than a socially determined one.

Women’s love for their children can be overwhelmed by a more powerful type of self-love: the fear of shame

Women, for Mandeville, are not naturally ashamed of their sexuality, but they are educated to feel shame. By simply observing the behaviour of modestly educated adult women, girls will learn to be careful about covering themselves in front of boys, and at a very young age they will be ashamed to show their legs, without even knowing the reasons why such an act is blameable. Educating the young for life in society means stimulating their pride – that is, increasing their fear of shame in relation to behaviour, words or attitudes that are considered blameworthy for their sex. In this pedagogy of shame, women are trained to be modest, men to be brave. Chastity and courage are both ‘artificial’ passions, the outcome of evolution, conventions and education.

While moral instruction trains all members of polite society to repress their sexual impulses, women are forced to exercise greater self-control than men. For Mandeville, simply because the male sexual",1
"appetite is considered to be more violent and uncontrollable, there is less expectation that men follow the norms of modesty. They can take greater liberties, while women have to carry a heavier social burden. This double standard allows men to pursue sexual gratification without much fear of public disapproval, but women are left to defend their reputation of chastity against social censure: ‘it is the interest of the society to preserve decency and politeness; that women should linger, waste, and die, rather than relieve themselves in an unlawful manner’.

In The Fable of the Bees, Mandeville uses a scene from everyday life to illustrate the social effects of double standards, explaining from a woman’s point of view the dynamics that lead to infanticide. While people from good families have the possibility to ‘sin’ unnoticed, servants and poor women rarely have the chance to conceal a ‘big belly’. A girl of good birth who is left penniless and forced to work as a maid can preserve her chastity for years, yet still encounter an unhappy moment when she surrenders her honour to a deceiver with power over her, who then neglects her. Mandeville observes that women like this are so",1
"overwhelmed by the social insistence on female chastity and the fear of public shame that they are likely to risk abortion and infanticide. The more intensely she fears shame, the more cruel her intentions will be, either towards herself or towards her unborn child. In such situations, women’s natural love for their children can be overwhelmed by a more powerful, socially inculcated type of self-love: the fear of shame. For Mandeville, contrary evidence that chastity is an artificial virtue peculiar to civilised society can be found in the fact that ordinary prostitutes rarely kill their children. This is not because they are less cruel or more virtuous, but because they have lost their modesty to a greater extent, meaning the fear of shame has little effect on them.

Infanticide is to artificial chastity as the duel is to artificial courage: a bloody tribute to the cult of the self on which modern honour is grounded. In Mandeville’s naturalistic account of sociability, the ‘virtues’ of chastity and courage are accounted for as the spontaneous social effects of pride and fear of shame, resulting from that key disposition that makes men fit for society: self-regard. Polite modern",1
"manners are but the latest stage in the history of pride: ‘the invention of honour … was an improvement in the art of flattery, by which the excellency of our species is raised to such a height, that it becomes the object of our own adoration, and man is taught in good earnest to worship himself.’

For Mandeville, morals and manners evolved over time, without any planning or design, from the dynamics of pride and shame and from the need to mask our natural, inescapable self-centredness. Civil society is the product of a gradual process and it is determined by man’s continuous efforts to satisfy a multiplicity of needs – the most prominent of which is what we call today ‘desire for recognition’. In this sense, the mechanisms by which self-gratifying motives produce socially advantageous outcomes – by which private vices are channelled into public benefits – are far from being attributable simply to the spontaneous order of the market. Before being ‘utility-maximisers’, human beings are primarily ‘esteem-seekers’, and their self-interest is always intertwined with the bottomless desire for recognition from others. Mandeville’s anatomy of human nature remains true today. The steps",1
"that led to our discovery of this strange life can be traced back to advances in DNA technology in the 1980s. For the first time, biologists could sequence the DNA from microbes directly, in any environment, without first growing these microbes in a laboratory. In 1998, Philip Hugenholtz, Norman Pace and colleagues at the University of California, Berkeley used this new technology to discover 12 deep branches on the tree of life in a Yellowstone National Park hot spring. The next year, Costantino Vetriani and Anna-Louise Reysenbach at Rutgers University in New Jersey and colleagues discovered even more new groups in deep-sea mud. None of these organisms had parallels in the known world of microbiology; they were entirely new to science. This new DNA-sequencing technology took off like wildfire, and scientists around the world, including myself as a young researcher, started discovering new types of life all over the place.

What we’ve discovered since has changed our conception of what life is like on Earth. Before these discoveries, it was unknown whether life can exist inside Earth’s crust. We now know that there is life under our feet, way under our feet. These",1
"subsurface-dwelling single-celled organisms are collectively called intraterrestrials, due to their parallels with the mystery and novelty of extraterrestrials. But, unlike space aliens, we know for certain that intraterrestrials exist.

Intraterrestrials comprise a vast still-mysterious ecosystem in Earth’s crust containing as many (or more) living microbial cells than are on Earth’s surface. We know this from scientists such as myself going out on scientific drilling ships that sample deep marine sediments or drilling deep into continental crust, laboriously counting the number of cells we find there, and extrapolating out to the rest of the world. The deepest we’ve found intraterrestrials thus far is about 5 km down. That’s deep enough for these intraterrestrials to never see the light of day, nor do they receive much food input from the surface world. Their world is mostly composed of tiny spaces between sediment grains or miniscule fractures in rocks. Rocks seem solid to",1
"us, but to very tiny life, rocks appear porous, with lots of places to live. From the few growing cultures that we have of these organisms, we know that many of them are tiny, and some have long appendages, such as the Asgard archaea and the Altiarchaeales, which may help them to hang on to their rock or sediment housing.

Although deep geological sources of food and nutrition (often in the form of deep gases and hydrothermal fluids) can support life in some parts of the subsurface, thousands of years or longer might pass with little to no food inputs. This extreme scarcity has extraordinary implications for life. In much of this vast biosphere, there’s not enough energy to drive microbial cell division at anything like a normal rate. Before discovering",1
"these organisms, we had a narrower view of how much energy life requires and how long a single organism can stay alive.

But how long can a cell live like this? Theoretically, there’s no limit

The intraterrestrials are showing us that we were wrong; life can exist on orders of magnitude lower power and sustain their living cells for orders of magnitude more years than previously thought possible. This means that many of these living beings bump up against the energetic limits of life, and in the process seem to have cracked the code for near-immortality. These types of intraterrestrials have such extremely long lifespans that we need a new term to describe the type of extremophiles that they are. The word aeonophiles fits, since they like (-phile) long periods of time (aeon-). (If they could read, I’m sure they’d be die-hard subscribers to Aeon magazine too.)

Many of these aeonophile types of intraterrestrials survive on thousands of times lower power than the amount required to maintain a next-to-dead non-growing culture of normal bacteria. This means that even though the deep subseafloor is one of the largest ecosystems on Earth, hardly any of the microbes that live there are actually growing. They have 0.00001 per cent of the power that supports all other known types of cell growth on Earth, so even performing a single cell division is impossible.

Aeonophiles funnel all the meagre power that’s available to them into replacing broken body parts, not dividing into two new daughter cells. So, long-term metabolically active dormancy is the only option. But how long can a cell live like this? Theoretically, there’s no limit if it slowly replaces its broken bits over time. This brings up a real conundrum. On the one hand, if anything like",1
"immortality were common, then we would be surrounded by beings that were born sometime around the origin of life, which is not the case. But on the other hand, these aeonophiles seem like they could live forever.

Luckily, there’s a lot of temporal real estate between a 20-minute doubling time and immortality. What if the aeonophiles live for 500,000 years or a million years? The oldest sediments that have not yet metamorphosed into rock are about 100 million years old, so this is an upper limit on the age of an individual cell in marine sediments. Older rocks could have older cells, as long as the rock has not been buried to sterilising temperatures over the course of its journey around our tectonically active planet.

To us, they look like they’re doing nothing. As an analogy, over a geological timescale, the California coastline is a constantly churning mass of rocks, but on our human timescale, it is stable enough to build a house on, which can be passed on to our grandchildren. These houses must be sound enough to withstand the occasional earthquake, but they will not survive the reorientations of land as they are spun, submerged, and exhumed over the course of a few million",1
"years. To think like an aeonophile, we have to grapple with some incomprehensible timescales.

How did these organisms evolve to stop growing for thousands of years? To answer this, first we might consider what they would experience in their lifetimes. They wouldn’t be concerned about the length of a day. They’re buried so deep that they can’t detect the Sun anyway. They probably wouldn’t even notice the seasons. However, they might care about other, and longer, geological rhythms: the opening and closing of oceanic basins through plate tectonics, the formation and subsidence of new island chains, or new fluid flows brought on by slow cracks opening in Earth’s crust. The biology I was taught in school considered these events to be evolutionary drivers for a species, not an individual. For instance, Charles Darwin’s finches evolved new beak shapes because they had been isolated on an archipelago.

We know that animals adapt to the daily or yearly rhythms of their environment, but it seems ridiculous to argue that any creature could anticipate tectonic cycles. It may, however, be reasonable for the aeonophiles. An individual that lives for a million years might be evolutionarily",1
"predisposed to count on something as slow as island subsidence in the same way that we are evolutionarily predisposed to wait for the Sun to rise tomorrow. To fully understand aeonophiles, we may have to rethink what qualifies as an evolutionary cue.

You may also wonder: how does evolution work for an organism that seemingly never produces offspring? According to Darwin’s theory of natural selection, these cells must grow and make new progeny to evolve. But how? I don’t think Darwin had nongrowth in mind when he described survival of the fittest. The answer to the question at the beginning of this paragraph lies in the word ‘seemingly’. They’re not producing offspring in the places that we normally look for them, but there has to be a place or time when they do make progeny.

We need to jailbreak our brains from our implicit assumptions about lifespan

Luckily, we have a good model in short-term seasonal dormancy, which various surface organisms enter for months before emerging to reproduce. Here dormancy during winter has an evolutionary advantage: by avoiding harsh, cold conditions, dormant organisms get the chance to have larger populations than non-dormant organisms in the",1
"spring. This provides a head start, allowing them to pass along their dormancy genes to a larger population of progeny. Textbook Darwinian natural selection.

To imagine dormancy that lasts for thousands of years, we have to think of an event that aeonophiles could possibly be waiting for. If we encounter a dormant microbe in soil in winter, we can presume that it’s holding out for summer. What is the equivalent situation for a deeply buried marine sediment organism waiting for thousands to millions of years?

Before we answer that question, let’s first consider a thought experiment to jailbreak our brains from our implicit assumptions about lifespan. Imagine human lives lasted only 24 hours. You’d be born at midnight, rebel against your parents at breakfast, settle down and have babies just before lunch, and pick up fishing as a retirement hobby around dinnertime. By midnight, your loved ones, who themselves were born only a few hours ago, would huddle close and hold your hand as you’d pass away peacefully at the ripe old age of a day. If everyone did that, hundreds of human generations would come and go within a single winter. Throughout that time span, which would represent a",1
"significant chunk of human history, the deciduous trees would remain brown and lifeless. The permanent deadness of trees would be taken as an undisputed fact, and scientists like me would probably apply for grants to understand whether or not trees are alive, given that they don’t seem to grow or make progeny. Of course, if you stretched back far enough, humans would have been present for the fall or even summer, but that might have been so many generations back that a stable form of writing had yet to be invented. We 100-year-lifespan humans know that trees are just waiting to take advantage of the summer sun. But the day-lifespan humans would be stumped.

When we think about life in the subsurface, are we like day-lifespan humans contemplating a tree? Are long-lived aeonophiles waiting for wake-up cues we don’t recognise because our lives are too short to see them? What is even the point of living for hundreds of thousands of years anyway? There must be some reason these aeonophiles stick around so long.

Seasonal cycles are way too fast. The only things slow enough are geological processes. For instance, island subsidence, floods or droughts often occur on 100- to 1,000-year",1
"cycles. Submarine landslides, earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions might shift materials around on even longer timescales, exposing aeonophiles to new food sources that coax them out of dormancy after hundreds of thousands of years. It seems odd to say that a microbe is adapted to wait for something as infrequent as a volcanic eruption, but you can rely on them to happen, as long as you’ve got time to wait.

If we really let our imagination run wild, individual microbes might be adapted to events with even longer periods, like interglacial cycles, which shift every 30,000 years or so. Or the slow movement of tectonic plates. As a new seafloor pops up in midocean ridges, the existing seafloor is constantly pushed from the middle of the ocean, until it eventually jams into a continent in the slowest-motion train wreck ever.

Some marine sediments – and the aeonophiles that live in them – will get dragged down on the subducting plate and destroyed. Even for extremophiles, the",1
"mantle is an evolutionary dead end. However, some seafloor sediments survive these collisions – rather than subducting, they are scraped off and shoved onto a continental plate. Could all this piling up, faulting and burbling up to the surface be what the aeonophiles are waiting for? Is this an aeonophiles’ version of summer?

Living on human timescales, it’s hard to say for certain. However, we do know that the aeonophiles are showing us that some Earthlings can live for many thousands of years or longer. In my opinion, these are fundamental discoveries about the nature of life on Earth. In fact, I believe that the discovery of ultra-long-lived creatures is up there with the discovery of hyperthermophiles, microbes that thrive at temperatures above the boiling point of water. When hyperthermophiles were discovered in the 1960s, it blew open our understanding of where life might exist in the Universe. I foresee a similar seismic shift from the discovery of aeonophiles.

The existence of such organisms greatly expands the window of time during which we can look for biomarkers in the cosmos. In fact, they raise the troubling possibility that, if life on other planets is extremely",1
"slow, it might also be nearly impossible to detect. As we examine other planetary bodies, we look for changes that might signify that something is alive and doing work on that planet. But if that life is extremely slow, we may not realise we’re looking at it because it doesn’t change much while we’re observing it. It is not impossible that beneath the surface of Mars or Europa, things are alive and functioning much more slowly than the life that we’re used to.

By living as slow as they do, aeonophiles prompt us to consider how we define life and non-life. How can we scientifically distinguish between the two? For answers, I believe we need to think of life, in its most basic function, as an energetic phenomenon. And to do that, it’s necessary to look at it through the lens of thermodynamics.

In their book Into the Cool (2005), the scientist Eric Schneider and the writer Dorion Sagan suggest that life and non-life exist in a continuous line. At one end of the spectrum are non-living systems at energetic equilibrium; and at the other end are living systems continuously creating further energetic potential to make sure they stay well out of equilibrium. So, one way to define life",1
"would be that it is good at creating energetic opportunities to push things far out of equilibrium.

If we’re talking about energy, we have to talk about the second law of thermodynamics, which is driving it all. The law says that, in a closed system, entropy – roughly the number of ways a system can be arranged – tends to increase overall. As entropy rises, less of a system’s energy can be used to do work. We’ve long known that life is good at producing entropy; just look at the heat radiating from our bodies and even whole cities. Non-life can produce entropy too, though, so how does this help us tell the difference?

Aeonophiles show us that life has more creative ways of producing entropy than we thought possible

According to non-equilibrium thermodynamics, it is life’s propensity for continually pushing systems back out of equilibrium that sets it apart from non-life. Once things are well out of equilibrium, entropy can be produced in the race to regain equilibrium. Crucially, life seems to be better than non-life at creating new systems in which entropy can be produced. An eddy in a stream is not alive, but for a short amount of time, the water molecules become a whirlpool",1
"to maximise entropy production through energy dissipation from the system. Life does this too, but it’s more sophisticated and effective in its approach. Non-life makes whirlpools, but life dams the river to go whitewater rafting on those whirlpools. Non-living asphalt heats up when sunlight hits it, creating a bit of entropy, but a rainforest places leaves at different levels capturing every last photon of light and turning it into biomass that will support an entire ecosystem of animals and fungi that produce more entropy per ray of light than asphalt ever could.

What the aeonophiles do for us is to show us that life has more creative ways of producing entropy than we previously thought possible. If the point of life is to create more entropy by spreading out its production over increasingly large scales of space and time, then this task seems tailor-made for aeonophiles. Simply by living for aeons, they may stretch out entropy production for longer timescales, maximising its final tally for the second law. Finding such an outlandish new way to create opportunities for entropy production supports the idea that this opportunity for entropy creation is, itself, the why of life.",1
"In short, life happens because the second law of thermodynamics demands it. And the aeonophiles, by their very long-lived existence, drive that point home for us.

Even though they may seem extraordinary to us, individuals that live for thousands of years or longer may be ordinary on Earth. In addition to showing us that life is far more diverse than we thought, and can use energy and time in ways we would never have dreamed up on our own, aeonophiles might be key to understanding why life exists. They’re showing us new ways for life to conduct its delicate dance with energy and entropy. As we continue to learn more about these strange intraterrestrials, and the aeonophiles among them, I believe we will continue smashing our preconceived notions of how life itself is supposed to work, one barely breathing cell at a time.",1
"Since the ancient Greek atomists and the upending of a solipsistic worldview by Copernicus, we’ve toyed with the notion of a plurality of worlds, the idea that the Universe is brimming with planets and the stuff that might be on them. But, apart from a few false starts, astronomy was hard-pressed to detect other worlds around even the nearest stars to our Sun. The surrounding cosmos has, when it comes to planets, been a great mound of barren soil as unprepossessing as my childhood garden.

This began to change in the early 1990s. First came the confirmation of planet-sized objects orbiting a distant pulsar — the fast-spinning, ultra-dense remains of a stellar core, left behind from an ancient supernova. Pulsars tend to beam out their pulses of radiation into the Universe with astonishing regularity, but this one’s pulses exhibited small variations, tiny, time-stamped changes that revealed the gravitational tugs of planetary bodies. These are likely the zombie remnants of matter left after the star’s explosive death millennia ago, now re-coalesced into entire worlds. Unexpected and strange, these were the first hints of what was to come. Just a few years later, in 1995, a giant",1
"planet was detected orbiting a regular Sun-like star known as 51 Pegasi. This measurement was a feat of spectroscopic detective work, which registered the fine Doppler shifts induced on the star by the gravity of an unseen world.

These new planets, and the ones to immediately follow, were utterly alien. The half Jupiter-sized companion to 51 Pegasi orbits once every 4.2 Earth-days, well within the orbit of Mercury in our own system. The next two planets discovered around other stars, 70 Virginis b and 16 Cygni Bb, further disturbed any tidy theory about the structure of solar systems. They have highly elliptical orbits that swing them to and from their parent stars with wild abandon. It was too soon to construct statistics about the abundance of these ‘exo’ planets, but the writing was on the wall: the cosmos makes worlds with an extraordinary diversity.

Since that time, the number of planets known to us has swelled beyond the dozens, the hundreds, and now teeters above a couple of thousand — maybe more, depending on how confident we are in our (largely indirect) methods of detection. These are the subtle Doppler changes in the spectral hues we see as a star tangos about its",1
"system’s fulcrum point, or the minuscule dip of light that occurs when a planet transits the unresolved face of its star, dimming the light we see by perhaps as little as 0.003 per cent. Or even the hour-by-hour changes of a distantly glowing stellar backdrop, as the gravitational distortion of a foreground star and its planets focuses and brightens the surrounding field of view. These ridiculously difficult measurements have become state-of-the-art components in the ultra-sophisticated technological machinery of planet hunting.

Indeed, the greatest barriers to expanding our catalogue of other worlds have less to do with our devices and more to do with the fact that stellar astrophysics is a messy business. The upwelling and down-welling of plasma on a star’s visible surface produces measurement errors and statistical noise that can obscure the delicate effects of surrounding planets. Especially those like Earth, whose own presence induces a mere 9cm per second motion on our Sun. Finding planets can be like looking for the gentle swaying of a wheatfield brought on by the beating of a bird’s wings, while all around a hurricane blows.

Despite these limitations, we now know that",1
"the diversity of planet sizes and orbital configurations is enormous. For example, the most numerous types of planet seem to be those somewhere between the size of Earth and a few times larger. Since we’ve yet to peer very far into the pool of much smaller objects, this statistic holds true for now. There is a kind of Copernican surprise lurking at the heart of this statistic: it means that the most numerous type of planet is not represented in our own solar system.

There could be about 23 billion stars in our Milky Way galaxy, each harbouring Earth-sized planets with life-friendly temperatures

Many exoplanets also follow orbits that are far more elliptical than any followed by the major planets around our Sun. More puzzling still, the most frequent type of configuration, the one that has earned the moniker of ‘the default mode of planetary formation’, is that of closely packed worlds, on orbits that take mere days or weeks to loop around their stars. These compressed versions of our own system seem, for now, to be far more normal than our own. But if we’re not normal, what are we? That’s a question we can’t answer yet, because our census of stars and planets is still woefully",1
"incomplete.

Nonetheless, there is something we can do with this wealth of data. We can make a statistical extrapolation from the worlds we’ve found to those we’ve yet to see. Although these different techniques of planet detection come with different biases and systematic effects, we’re sorting through the issues, and a consistent picture is starting to emerge, a picture of extraordinary cosmic wealth.

Just how many planets are there? This is such an active field of research that it can be hard to know which study to quote, so I’ll simply take one of the more recent and representative examples, whose results are pegged to NASA’s Kepler mission, a telescope that has patiently monitored some 140,000 stars in a distant patch of the Milky Way, looking for those tiny dips of light as mosquito-like planets nip across the face of their parent stars.

In this study, by the astronomers Courtney Dressing and David Charbonneau at Harvard, published in The Astrophysical Journal in February 2013, the focus is on stars smaller than our Sun. Not only is it easier to spot transiting planets around little stars, little stars are far more numerous than big stars. These ones, called M-dwarfs and",1
"K-dwarfs, are anywhere from half to one-10th the mass of the Sun, and there are 12 times more of them than of Sun-sized stars in our galactic neighbourhood. In other words, they represent 75 per cent of all stars in our galaxy, an excellent group upon which to work up population statistics. From the data we have now, it looks like planets ranging from half of Earth’s width to four times larger appear to be circulating around 90 per cent of these small suns, with orbits of 50 Earth-days or fewer. Bigger planets, and planets on larger orbits — well, there are going to be plenty of those, too. The estimated number of Earth-sized planets orbiting around these stars at a distance that allows for the possibility of a temperate surface (capable of holding that biological elixir — liquid water) varies from study to study, but it’s coming in at about one per seven systems. Given the concentration of these small stars locally, there is a 95 per cent probability that one of these potentially temperate worlds sits within a mere 16 light years of Earth. There could be about 23 billion stars in our Milky Way galaxy, each harbouring Earth-sized planets with life-friendly temperatures on their",1
"surfaces.

Twenty-three billion, give or take a few. This estimate tallies with others. Some studies produce numbers of Earth-sized planets closer to 17 billion, all in different orbital configurations. Others suggest a figure as low as 6 billion or so, but these are just the planets close to Earth in size. If we extend our reach to slightly larger worlds, the places now known as ‘super-Earths’, we’re back into the tens of billions. No matter how you slice the cosmic cake, you end up with a vast wedge of planets that we’d be happy to go and study, perhaps even land on and cautiously tiptoe about. These are mind-blowingly huge numbers. The cosmos makes temperate planets aplenty.

It’s quite striking to see how past thinkers seldom separated the existence of a planet from the existence of life on it

So what does this mean for us, and our puzzlement over our place in the Universe? It certainly tells us that Earth is likely one of many other planets in the cosmos with at least some attributes in common. But it feels like it should mean more. Doesn’t it mean something for our questions about whether there’s other life out there somewhere? It does, but not in the way we might first",1
"assume.

From the time of the atomists of ancient Greece, the idea of a plentitude, even infinitude, of other places in nature, other worlds, has had considerable allure. More than 2,000 years ago, the philosopher Democritus is said to have written:

There are countless worlds of different sizes. In some of them, neither the sun nor the moon are present; in others, they are larger than ours, still others have more than one of them… some prosper, others are in decline… Some worlds have no animal or vegetable life, nor any water at all.
Here, the ‘worlds’ are really universes — conceptual, metaphorical constructs of other natural places. But ideas like these inspired the later atomists such as Epicurus and his followers to embrace more tangible models of plurality: notions of countless places more akin to real planets and Earth-like environments, all existing within an infinite space. Not everyone was on board, naturally. The idea that new Earths existed elsewhere was fiercely opposed by Aristotle, the great champion of geo-centrism.

But when Copernicus issued his bold cosmological vision of a de-centralised Earth in the mid-16th century, a new generation began to wonder if the",1
"Universe might be filled with planets like ours. In Rome the priest, philosopher and scientist Giordano Bruno was burned at the stake for heresy in 1600. His heretical actions included his vigorous promotion of the idea that the stars were suns with their own planets. A bit later, in the influential book Entretiens sur la pluralité des mondes, or Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds (1686), the French polymath Bernard Le Bovier de Fontenelle mused on the possibility that all stars harboured worlds like those of our solar system. Piece by piece, these ideas made the Universe bigger and bigger, and our place in it smaller and smaller.

Voltaire got in on the act, too. In his satirical work Micromégas (1752), giant beings from Sirius and Saturn puzzle over microscopic Earth and its tiny denizens, discovering to their surprise that humans actually have intelligence. But when these superior beings leave humanity a book that purports to explain the meaning of existence, it is found to contain only blank pages.

The idea that the Universe is filled with planets drew supporters from a variety of intellectual disciplines. The natural philosopher Christiaan Huygens was an enthusiast,",1
"the astronomer William Herschel took to it, and so did the poet Alexander Pope, who wrote, in 1734:

He, who through vast immensity can pierce,
See worlds on worlds compose one universe,
Observe how system into system runs,
What other planets circle other suns,
What varied Being peoples every star,
May tell why Heaven has made us as we are.
There is a remarkable commonality among all these dreams of plurality. All of them share the unquestioned assumption that planets, or plantlike environments, equate to life, and vice versa. In fact, it’s quite striking to see how past thinkers seldom separated the existence of a planet from the existence of life on it.

Today though, astronomers constantly fret over whether or not a world is the right size, the right composition, or in the ‘habitable zone’ — the region around a star that allows for liquid water. We don’t assume that planets are necessarily occupied. Instead, astronomers and astrobiologists like myself spend our days trying to figure out if there are any planets with the right characteristics to harbour life.

Whether we’re one in a billion, or the product of a predictable life-generating apparatus, the outcome looks the same to",1
"the observer after the fact

Yet, for all of this scientific caution, we’re still wishful thinkers. We still want to be able to find life. Like many of my colleagues, I have, on several occasions, succumbed to that alluring view that planets equal life. But the crucial difference between us and past advocates of plurality is that we have information they never had. We actually know that planets are abundant, that they are an atomist’s dream no longer. And yet, the abundance of planets itself actually changes very little about the probability that life exists elsewhere in the Universe.

Instead, what it does is fundamentally alter the nature of the question itself, and that in turn leads to an even deeper and rather surprising truth. To understand it, let’s return to my story of the lonesome bulb in a spring garden and bring it into the realm of the cosmos.

Imagine, for a moment, an alternative reality. Imagine we discovered that the Sun was the sole planet-harbouring star in the galaxy, or for that matter the Universe. What would this actually tell us about the probability of abiogenesis, the spontaneous generation of life? It’s tempting to think that our existence would be proof",1
"positive that, so long as you have a planet, life is extremely probable. If it weren’t, the likelihood that the one planetary system in all existence would carry life would seem fantastical.

But this is post-hoc analysis, which can be misleading. The fact that life exists on this imaginary solitary Earth tells us next to nothing about whether life is probable or highly improbable because if we hadn’t already emerged on this planet then we wouldn’t be able to ask the question in the first place. Whether we’re one in a billion, or the product of a predictable life-generating apparatus, the outcome looks the same to the observer after the fact. It would be just like my childhood self getting his hopes up because he’d quickly come across a bulb in one spot of a great and untilled patch of soil.

Of course, this is not entirely fair. In the real universe, there is a teeny bit of information in the fact that microbial life appears to have emerged very early on Earth, just a few hundred million years after our planet assembled. This does seem to tell us a little about how life arises in the Universe, but as a single data point it places few meaningful constraints on the range of rates",1
"for abiogenesis. Life could still crop up often, or very infrequently — we don’t know which, because in either case we’d be here to ask the question.

But what if we found a second planet in this imaginary universe, around another star that could potentially harbour life? Suppose too that we were able to test whether or not there was life on this other world. Whether the answer was positive or negative, we’d be able to significantly improve our knowledge about the frequency of abiogenesis. The more habitable planets we found in our pretend cosmos, the more we could test them, in order to build and refine a mathematical model for the likelihood of life.

We live in a universe that allows us to get some measure of our own significance

Now let’s bring ourselves back to this universe, and our galaxy, the one full of temperate planets — tens of billions of them. What do all these planets tell us? They don’t tell us how common life is, but they do give us a shot at finding out. If we lived in a cosmos with only a few planets, we could never deduce the true probability of abiogenesis with any precision, even if they all harboured life — as imagined by earlier advocates of plurality. We",1
"might never be lucky enough to find one of these worlds within examining range, and all would be lost among the stellar fields of the Milky Way. The existence of billions of planets gives us a chance to write the equation, a chance to pin down the relationship between habitability and actual habitation. And it could have larger implications still.

Over the past century, scientists have noticed that many of the root physical characteristics of our universe, from the strength of gravity to the values of fundamental constants that determine atomic structure, all seem precisely aligned with the conditions that appear necessary for life to exist. Change a few of these constants and there’d be no stars like the Sun, there’d be no heavy elements like the carbon that builds our complex molecules, and so on.

Of course, it’s pretty obvious that if things weren’t the way they are then we wouldn’t be here to notice it in the first place. In that sense, this apparent ‘fine-tuning’ of the Universe for life is just a selection effect, an unavoidable bias of our existing in the first place. This ‘fine-tuning’ of nature is especially mysterious if you suppose that ours is the only universe, the",1
"only version of reality that has ever existed. Why should a one-off universe be tuned for the grubby little molecular pieces of our life? It’s a thorny problem that can lead to all kinds of interesting, and sometimes wild, interpretations. But fundamental physics and cosmology might hold the answer to this mystery.

Ever since the American philosopher and psychologist William James first coined the term ‘multiverse’ in 1895, there has been increasingly good reason to think that our universe is actually only one of many, part of a multiverse of other regions of space and time separated by distance and time, or dimension. Some theoretical frameworks suggest that there could be upwards of 10 to the power of 10 to the power of 16 distinct universes. Indeed, our investigations of the cosmos suggest that the same quantum physics of the vacuum that spawned our universe, and the awesome energy of inflating space that blows it up into the kind of place we occupy, is also well-suited to generating all of these other universes. We even have a shot at testing this through astrophysical measurements. If the theory holds, our fine-tuned universe will cease to be mysterious; it will simply be a",1
"part of a larger multiverse, a part that turned out suitable for life.

The special thing about our planet-rich universe is that it’s tuned both for life and for finding out about life. If we were back in our imaginary universe with only one planetary system, we would have no way of learning how frequently life arises. We live in a universe that allows us to get some measure of our own significance. There is nothing in our present understanding of the nature of life or the Universe that says this was absolutely necessary, yet here it is.

It’s not clear that we’ll ever be able to solve this puzzle. To start with, we need to build that equation for abiogenesis, we have to dig deeper in the astrophysical dirt to find places in the Universe that might harbour life, to follow nature’s breadcrumbs, as it were. The strategy is straightforward: seek out more worlds that might share some of Earth’s characteristics, and search their surfaces for the chemical signatures of life. It won’t be easy but, unlike 20 years ago, we now know we have a galaxy’s worth of planets to chase, and we know that if we persevere, the equation will eventually come into focus.

That this work is even possible",1
"has, in a very real sense, already changed our universe. Not because it’s told us anything quantitatively new about life elsewhere, but rather because it’s raised the stakes for evaluating our significance, our cosmic loneliness, to a whole new level. Not only are the fundamental properties of our universe aligned, and tuned to, the needs of life, they also promise success in our quest to discover life’s frequency, origins, and perhaps the very causes of this tuning itself. And it didn’t have to be like this at all. If you turn it over in your mind enough times, you realise that Albert Einstein was right when he said:  The understanding that life and heat are intertwined is very old knowledge. Moses, for one, was launched into his first encounter with the Creator of all life by the sight of a tree ablaze, burning with a marvellous fire that left the living organism unscathed.

In physics, heat is a form of energy, made up of the random movements and collisions of molecules as they bounce off each other at the nanoscale. Much of the world’s energy is tied up as heat. Although it sounds like something that just wobbles around in the background as other factors take centre stage, it",1
"actually plays a crucial role in making some of the most interesting kinds of behaviour possible. In particular, we’ll see that heat and time are bound together in an intricate dance, and the release of heat is what stops time going backwards.

Some things in the world seem reversible: I can kick a ball upward and it will rise, or I can drop a ball from a height, and it will fall. Putting it this way just seems like common sense, but it turns out that this pairing of dynamical trajectories, where one path looks like the time-reversed movie of the other, is a symmetry built into the basic mathematical structure of Newton’s laws. Anything that can go one way can go the other, if you just set it moving back the way it came. As a consequence, the most ‘normal’ thing in physics would be for events to be able to reverse themselves in time, just like the ball that goes up and then down.

We don’t immediately grasp the sweeping significance of time-reversal symmetry because a whole lot of what we see doesn’t seem to have this property. Little green shoots soak up the Sun and grow into mighty trees, but we never see a full-grown pine ‘ungrow’ itself into a cone buried in the dirt.",1
"Sandcastles disintegrate under the waves, but we never see them splash back together when the tide recedes. Countless examples of ordinary occurrences around us would look extraordinary if they happened in rewind. The ‘arrow of time’ seems to point in one direction, but there’s no obvious reason in principle to think it should. So what’s going on?

The short answer is that we’re not looking closely enough. When a piece of wood burns, an enormous amount of heat and chemical product is exchanged with the surrounding air. In order to run the tape backwards and spontaneously generate wood from ash and anti-flame, we’d have to somehow give every little molecule in the ash and atmosphere a backwards push to send it bouncing along the reverse track. That is not going to happen.

In a rigorous, quantitative sense, the dissipation of heat is the price we pay for the arrow of time

Many scientific commentators have noted the connection between heat and the arrow of time. However, only in the past 20 years or so have physicists developed a crisp, comprehensive formulation of the relationship. One of the most important contributions came from a theorist named Gavin Crooks, now at the Lawrence",1
"Berkeley National Lab in the United States. He asked the following question: given that I have a movie (say, of a piece of wood burning to ash or a plant growing) and the rewind version of that movie, how would I tell which one is more likely to happen?

By applying some basic assumptions, he was able to mathematically prove the following. If you have a system (a piece of wood or a plant, for example) surrounded by a ‘bath’ of randomly jiggling particles (say, the atmosphere), the more heat the system releases into its bath, the less likely it is to rewind itself. In a rigorous, quantitative sense, the dissipation of heat is the price we pay for the arrow of time.

Why? Another way of phrasing this insight is to note that the more a system increases the entropy of its surroundings, the more irreversible it becomes. Now, it must be said that in the grand contest for the most misunderstood idea in the history of physics, entropy is probably the winner. Even people who are normally averse to any mention of the natural sciences will sagely volunteer that entropy – read: messiness, dysfunction, chaos, disorder, who knows? – must increase, all the time. It’s the second law of",1
"thermodynamics, obviously. But this simple picture can’t be right. Living organisms, for one, seem to defy this misleading gloss on the second law. They take disorganised bits and pieces of matter, and put them together in fiendishly complex and refined ways.

Thankfully, the full story is substantially more nuanced. Connoisseurs use entropy in a technical, microscopic sense, as a statistical measure of the number of different ways the same kind of arrangement of matter can be constructed out of its constituent parts. For a room full of air, for example, it turns out there are just many, many more ways of spreading out the molecules uniformly than there are of squishing them into clumps. That’s why uniform air density wins the entropic game, and nature abhors a vacuum. The particles diffuse themselves evenly because that’s just the most likely thing to happen over time.

The connection between entropy and heat is more subtle. Remember that heat is energy diffused randomly among the particles in a substance. The more energy, the more ways of sharing it around; and the more ways of sharing the energy around, the higher the entropy. Back to Crooks’s example of a system in a bath,",1
"then, the more heat a system releases, the more it increases the entropy of its surroundings – and, as Crooks showed, the less likely it is that this sequence of events could rewind itself.

This is what the second law means: the reason a heat-producing movie is more likely than its heat-absorbing re-run has to do with the number of ways you can disperse that heat in the surrounding bath. The more heat you throw into the bath, the less hope you have of getting it back from a freak fluctuation, and the less likely it is that you will have the energy you need to retrace your steps once the movie has run forward. It’s like releasing a bagful of feathers into a gusting wind and hoping to catch them with a net. If you only release one feather, the gale might blow it back to you; but if you release hundreds or thousands, the chance of capturing them all is basically nil.

Now we can bring life into the picture. Living things clearly have energy to burn, and they get this energy from being worked on. Like heat, ‘work’ in thermodynamics involves units of energy. But instead of the uncoordinated wiggling of molecules, here it’s a measure of how much and how fast energy has been transferred",1
"to a system from its surroundings in a way that produces a change. There are a variety of versions, such as movement, volume change and chemical transformation. What unites these processes is that energy is being forced, pushed or driven into a system from the outside, in a way that modifies the system’s shape or location. When you hit a car, it might move, or you might dent it, or both. In any case, you’ve done work on it.

Life is superb at capturing energy through work. Growing a plant means doing work on it, no less than when we put shoulder to yoke and drag a cart up a hill. In these situations the conservation of energy required by Newton’s laws implies one of two things: either all the energy put in as work stays stored in the system, like the compressed spring in a Jack-in-the-box; or else it’s released into the surroundings as heat. Recall, too, what we said before about the release of heat and time-reversal symmetry. So the question of how much work gets done, and when, makes all the difference to which events are more or less likely in the movie we’re watching.

Now we know why mighty trees don’t ungrow themselves: because life produces heat. From a physics perspective,",1
"a tree harvests energy from its surroundings – work is done on it – and in the process, it dissipates energy to the surrounding air as heat. The differences in probability between forward and reverse in such cases are staggering. Even ungrowing a single photosynthetic bacterium is less likely than growing one by a factor of roughly 1050 billion! Suffice it to say, once the work gets flowing (and dissipating), backwards movies usually cease to be worth even talking about.

With a few tricks of algebra, you can use Crooks’s equation to compare the likelihoods of two future events in a system that’s being pushed by external forces and surrounded by a bath of randomly jiggling molecules. That includes the plant growing in the air, and anything that’s alive, in fact. So, if I zap a chemical mixture with electric shocks, or mechanically vibrate the container of a viscous fluid – does thinking about work and heat help me to predict if something resembling life might eventually emerge, after some energy has been allowed to flux through the system? Perhaps, but with a twist.

To probe the implications of work for how life (and evolution) evolved, a more versatile analogy is required. Let’s",1
"imagine a battery-powered car, exploring a rugged mountain range. Mathematically, the car’s location can be thought of as corresponding to the full microscopic configuration of a system composed of many different particles. Every spot on the terrain that the car might be, we can think of as a unique and different way of arranging all the molecular building blocks of some larger object. Accordingly, we have to think of the car not as having four cardinal directions to drive in, but rather, 1025 or more! And somewhere, out on that vast sierra, there’s a spot that represents a bacterium, a plant, a cat.

At any given moment, our car is furiously spinning its wheels, winding its way slowly up over a narrow pass, or bouncing rapidly down into another ravine. From time to time, the car randomly swerves and changes direction. This is a reasonable metaphor for a system that undergoes changes in energy, but doesn’t experience external drives that do work on it. Sometimes, the car goes uphill; this corresponds to our system absorbing heat and storing the energy, like the spring in a jack-in-the-box. Sometimes, the car goes downhill, which we’d liken to the clown popping out of the box as",1
"the spring is released.

So where does the exploring car end up? Both intuition and a more rigorous treatment of the physics tell us that two basic factors are going to affect what happens. First, the car is more likely to drive to places that are close to its starting point, and separated from that point by relatively flat terrain. Second, it will tend to go downhill more than it tends to go uphill. After a very long time, we might expect the car to wander so much that we’d have no idea where it was at the beginning – but its avoidance of hilltops and preference for valleys would probably remain.

Think of an opera singer who shatters a goblet with the perfect pitch of her song, due to a phenomenon known as resonance

To bring work into the picture, we just need to give the car a solar panel. This makes its wheels spin more vigorously when it’s positioned and angled so that the Sun is brightest. Now the rules of thumb for how the car explores are going to get dramatically more complicated. All things being equal, we’d still expect the car to stay close to home, go downhill, and avoid rugged terrain (at least until it gets stuck). In addition, we now have to think about the places",1
"and times that the car will get a power-boost from the Sun overhead. There are going to be cases where the car can more readily traverse a sunny hill than a shady plain, because of the extra help it gets by staying in the bright spots.

Given enough time, we can no longer be confident that we’ll find the car in some deep valley near home base; instead, we have to think about how far and how fast it might have travelled if it found a path on which the Sun kept shining. Described in this way, the vehicle’s dynamics are affected by a dizzying variety of factors, and there are many more possibilities for where the mountain-rover might go.

The solar-powered mountain-rover metaphor helps us to think about the evolution of a very diverse range of work-absorbing systems. Of course, the prospect of sifting through such a vast space of possibilities and landing on life at first seems hopeless. But things look different once we ask a simple question, namely: what determines which places are sunny, and which places aren’t?

At least part of the answer comes from the peculiarities of how a system’s structure allows it to connect with its surrounding energy source. Children often notice that a",1
"wineglass will ring at a different pitch depending on how much water is poured into it. A different, but related observation is that vessels made from the same amount of glass, and filled with the same amount of water, can ring at different pitches depending on their shape.

What this reveals is that the way matter is arranged can significantly affect how it tends to move and vibrate. Not only that, but the details of such an arrangement also change how matter absorbs work energy from its surroundings. Think of an opera singer who shatters a goblet with the perfect pitch of her song, due to a phenomenon known as resonance. Here, because the glass tends to vibrate at a frequency that is well-matched to the frequency of the sound, the oscillations in the glass produced by the energy in the sound waves are violent enough to break it.

We encounter the work-absorbing peculiarities of how matter is arranged all around us: from the ways pigment molecules absorb and scatter light so that we perceive them as having colours, to the fact that we can digest and be nourished by the starch in a potato more than by the cellulose in a bale of hay. From the perspective of chemical physics, a",1
"human being’s inability to eat grass is just about how the atoms that comprise a person’s digestive system are arranged. If these same carbons, nitrogens, oxygens and so on were re-fashioned into a cow stomach, the chemical work stored in grass would be ours for the taking.

It’s when we take this idea back to our solar-powered rover that things get interesting. Suppose we start with a collection of chemical building blocks in a thrown-together, uninteresting structure. That corresponds to parachuting the car into a randomly chosen starting location in the mountain range. But now, suppose that we subject these chemical building blocks to a challenging external environment – to a collection of energy sources that are accessible in principle, but only available in practice when the chemicals are arranged in rare, specially-matched shapes that happen to solve the problem of how to absorb work. For the rover, which we have said has unimaginably many possible directions to drive in, the challenging environment manifests as a landscape that’s mostly not very sunny, except when you are driving in just the right direction, in the right place, at the right time.

The system exhibits a",1
"self-reinforcing process that grows its ability to absorb work

Sure, it’s still not easy to tell where the rover must go in general. But there are particular scenarios where the matters become significantly clearer. We might think of a case in which the rover starts off in a sunny spot, spins its wheels furiously, and speeds to a new place in the shade, where its wheels grind mostly to a halt. Having been carried irreversibly to a new place by the absorption and dissipation of work, it then gets stuck in a shape that is bad at absorbing energy. That’s roughly equivalent to the opera singer shattering the goblet. At the beginning, the glass resonates and absorbs a lot of work from the song, which gets largely dissipated as heat when the glass shatters and settles into an inert heap of shards. Once in this state, the shards no longer resonate, and the rate of work absorption drops significantly.

We can also envision the opposite scenario. Suppose we have a single bacterium sitting in a big jar of food and oxygen. After 20 minutes or so, we should have two bacteria, and 20 minutes later gets us two more. What we expect to see, in the short term, is a process of exponential",1
"population growth. Individual bacteria harness the chemical work available in their surroundings, and pay the thermodynamic cost of making copies of themselves. Since the number of bacteria is growing, the rate of work absorption is also constantly increasing – at least until the food runs out and the party stops. We can liken this process to a rover that gets a bit of sunshine, which helps it edge its way a bit further out of the shade, so that its wheels speed up even more and carry it to an ever-sunnier location over time. The system in this case exhibits a sustained, self-reinforcing process that grows its ability to absorb work from the environment.

Note that there’s nothing in this thermodynamic description of reproduction that specifically picks out the notion of a discrete entity (such as a bacterium) reproducing itself. Rather, self-replication is just one example of a more general class of processes that exhibit what we call positive feedback. Positive feedback can happen whenever there’s a quantity in a system whose increase brings about a rise in its own rate of growth. In the case of self-replicating cells, the quantity in question is the number of cells itself: a",1
"larger number of cells can make more cells faster. However, one can also envision self-reinforcing behaviours that have to do with the shape or arrangement of a system as a whole; and in that case, the exploring rover story remains the same as ever. Looking at life this way allows us to recognise a similar feedback signature in cases where no self-copying self is apparent.

Just to recap where we’ve travelled. Living things manage not to fall apart as fast as they form because they constantly increase the entropy around them. They do this because their molecular structure lets them absorb energy as work and release it as heat. Under certain conditions, this ability to absorb work lets organisms (and other systems) refine their structure so as to absorb more work, and in the process, release more heat. It all adds up to a positive feedback loop that makes us appear to move forward in time, in accordance with the extended second law.

This process takes on a special significance in a setting like that of the vibrating glass. Here, the environmental energy source presents a particular challenge, such that the system (the glass) can only absorb energy if it adopts the right shapes.",1
"That’s equivalent to our rover finding that rare sliver of sunlight and managing to drive in just the right way to stay in the bright spots. If something about the system’s configuration lets it use the absorbed energy to power a feedback loop in a challenging scenario, you end up with a recipe for a system that evolves over time into more and more finely-tuned, specialised, energy-absorbing shapes. If you leave a lump of glass in the presence of a soprano for long enough, the shape it ultimately takes should depend on the precise pitch(es) she chooses to sing at.

In my research group’s first theoretical papers on this subject, we have referred to this mechanism of self-organisation as dissipative adaptation. Recently, we conducted two tests of the idea with computer simulations. In one study, we took a mixture of simple dots or points floating in viscous fluid. To make the environment more challenging, we imposed a simple rule: each pair of points was connected by a stretchy spring, which could randomly hook or unhook when close together. We then took one of the points amongst a group of 20 of them and pushed on it with an oscillating force of a single frequency.

What we saw",1
"next was intriguing. As the springs randomly hooked and unhooked, a specific network of tangled connections formed. These connections tended to vibrate at the frequency of the external force – hence they absorbed an exceptionally large amount of energy. Alternatively, when we engineered it so that the springs snapped more readily when stretched, we saw the opposite effect, like the opera singer’s shattered glass: a network formed that was attuned to not vibrate at that frequency. That is, the points adapted their shape to not absorbing energy.

the life-like specialness of organisms, which allows them to eat and survive and reproduce, might be recognisable in a broader physical class of systems

We got similar results in a second study. Here we put an initially randomly arranged collection of atoms in the presence of a rich but challenging source of energy that could only be accessed by a special combination of those atoms. After letting the atoms react for a long time, the composition of chemicals was biased to be either unusually bad or extremely good at extracting energy. In other words, the system exhibited a tendency to find and stay stuck in states that look adapted to their",1
"environment.

In both these cases, the point is not that all matter everywhere is trying to absorb and dissipate more energy all the time; nor is it that the second law of thermodynamics is magically guiding the discovery of organised structures that are better at increasing entropy. Rather, when particles interact under the challenging conditions created by an energy source, their resulting shapes tend to be fine-tuned to that energy source – even without the help of self-replication and natural selection.

As it happens, living things are both marvellously complex and breathtakingly good at meeting the challenges of their environments. We know this is because the life we see today has inherited many of the structural and behavioural adaptations that proved so useful to previous generations. In the biological context, ‘usefulness’ is that which enables survival and self-reproduction. But what’s beginning to emerge from some of this thermodynamic thinking – and what a few of us are eagerly exploring in simulation and experiment – is the possibility that some of the distinctively life-like specialness of how organisms are organised, and which allows them to eat and survive and",1
"reproduce, might be recognisable in a broader physical class of systems that do not contain self-copying selves. Instead, they are propelled towards strikingly special shapes by the thermodynamic laws governing positive feedback in the presence of a challenging energy source. This process might explain how evolution can get going in inert matter.

Whether this will ultimately make a big or small difference in how we understand living things at the microscopic level, we don’t know. There’s still more work to be done. But what our new vantage point on thermodynamics reveals is that a great many uncharted, and seemingly random, explorations of shape and form have a surprisingly good chance of ending up somewhere interesting – perhaps even the summit of the very distant mountaintop that we occupy on that unimaginably huge terrain, with a tiny flag reading ‘humanity’. My hypothesis for Zeta’s surprising expulsion from the family was that, in this scrub desert with minimal resources, a mechanism of maintaining a smaller group might be required. This would lead to the selective removal of certain individuals.

There is so little food and very few waterholes in the northeast region of",1
"Etosha National Park in Namibia. It is sandveld and scrub desert terrain with low rainfall, such that our field season of June and July falls at the driest time of the year, in the dead of winter. During this time, all elephants in the region rely on a handful of places to drink. I had witnessed behaviours here consistent with rejection, which scientists had never described before. And the extreme aggression between families in the context of water rights was surprising, but perhaps not so surprising since water is critical to survival. I wanted to figure out what would explain these differences – specifically, whether elephants might have different cultures relative to their environmental pressures, and when and how dominant family members determine which low-ranking individual to kick out.

All eyes were fixed on family departures – and many elephantine buttocks – to collect the dung samples

Scientists have described family groups of elephants in Amboseli National Park in Kenya as being egalitarian in nature. It’s believed that when a matriarch passes, the next oldest and wisest female becomes the matriarch, rather than the daughter of the matriarch. But did the desert and its",1
"pinch on resources put pressure on this elephant society to produce a culture of monarchists with a queen ethos? In other words, was Zeta being removed because she was more distantly related to the matriarch than those expelling her? Such logic would favour the maintenance of a stronger matriarchal bloodline, rather than a broader family lineage.

Our research required collecting faecal samples from each individual elephant in order to extract DNA. This relatedness study needed all eyes fixed on family departures – and many elephantine buttocks – in order to collect the dung samples necessary for genetic analysis. Despite the challenges inherent in collecting dung, it was a lot easier than collecting hair, skin or blood, which used to be required for such studies. Colon cells slough off the lining of the colon while a bolus passes through the elephant’s intestines. The cells are present in the mucus coating on the faeces as well as within the faeces, making it possible to extract the DNA from known individuals for an analysis of relatedness.

Most defecations occurred as each family group departed from the waterhole. Therefore, careful mapping of the location of each known",1
"defecating individual was essential to ensure the accuracy of the data about which sample belonged to whom. But sometimes the focal family was chased off too quickly from the waterhole by a more dominant family. We then had to track individuals by their distinct tail-hair pattern (as that’s mostly what’s visible on a rapidly departing elephant). This is extremely challenging in itself, and dung also tends to get stepped on in the panic, which makes a sample useless for our purposes. Sometimes, there wouldn’t be enough time to run out and grab our critical samples before another thirsty family barrelled in and trampled all of our carefully tracked and mapped dung samples. So even a simple issue as where an elephant defecates could take a lot of time and technical fieldwork across years to address in a manner that gave us credible scientific data.

Finally, the Scimitars barrelled in. My team of eight had managed to set up our instrumentation and demography datasheets just in time. Chilonis, the matriarch, was in front, and everyone else followed in a bellowing frenzy, sand flying, as they charged the waterhole. Zeta led the next subfamily to break cover, all of them with ears",1
"pinned back and running as fast as they could.

We looked at each other for an explanation for such a panic. Surely, Zeta’s arrival wouldn’t cause this much distress, even if she were still unwelcome?

We quickly realised that another family had arrived. They were waiting behind the Scimitars, and were restless and agitating to beat them to the waterhole. It was the Warrior family, and they were coming in hot. They pushed Zeta’s subfamily off the direct path to the spring’s source – the prized position.

The Warrior family (foreground) races Zeta and her small subfamily of the Scimitars (background), for access to the head of the spring at the Mushara waterhole in Etosha National Park, Namibia

The Warrior strategy was to intimidate other families by running to the water, bellowing and screaming, gunning to establish themselves at the source of the spring before the other family got there. This had proven successful to date, as I had witnessed time and again over the years, but now, for the first time, I saw the Scimitars beaten.

I have been returning to the Mushara",1
"waterhole for 33 years. Every year, it’s a different experience. As a field biologist, there is always something to learn, some surprise that keeps me on my toes. This year, it was the unusually large amount of rain the country received between November 2024 and May 2025. These abundant rains meant that, even in July this year, there were many places for elephants to drink other than Mushara.

Why would female elephants kick out their own family member when females are thought to live together for life?

We had arrived at Mushara two weeks later than normal, but still we had to wait for the elephants to come. I needed to collect important remaining genetic samples to establish how the dominance hierarchy functioned within, but also between, resident elephant families, relative to relatedness.

Elephant scientists at Amboseli, a place where water is much more ubiquitous, have described elephant families as having a fission-fusion dynamic. The separating and coming-back-together observed in those elephant families is, however, described as a passive dynamic, whereby a subgroup of the family breaks away to form a separate group, seemingly willingly, ostensibly to facilitate moving",1
"through the environment with fewer individuals to coordinate. These subgroups of the family often remain within the range of acoustic contact, at a distance of around two to four kilometres, and routinely rejoin for a joyous greeting and a drink at a waterhole or along a river, depending on the environment, before moving off their separate ways again.

Families that had permanently split into two subfamilies at Mushara didn’t appear to have such amicable relations – only those subfamilies that were temporarily separated and then regrouped within a day or two enjoyed such reunions. Even within families here, we were witnessing something different. There was an active dynamic, whereby dominant family members would chase off another family member, particularly when she was heavily pregnant or just after the birth of her calf. We had seen Zeta of the Scimitars rejected by Chilonis or Chilonis’s ‘muscle’, the second-ranking Cutlass.

Why would female elephants kick out a member of their own family when females are thought to live together for life? The idea of dominant individuals being the only ones ‘allowed’ to reproduce within hierarchical societies is well documented in some",1
"species of primates, wild dogs and other close-knit groups such as meerkats. This preferred position of breeding dominance is usually accomplished via hormonal suppression. Yet, hormonal suppression among female elephants within a family group in the wild has not been well documented.

Female elephants live within a matriarchal society, where coming-of-age males are encouraged to leave the family between the age of 12 to 15. Sometimes, these young males leave under pressure, as they are not necessarily ready to leave the security and social life of a family group. Other times, it appears mutual, where the females are ready for the young males to stop occupying all the best resources, and the young males look forward to their freedom as they enter adult male society.

At one time, the departure of young males from their family was an important evolutionary mechanism to disperse genes to prevent inbreeding, as young males would wander long distances to find a new home range. It’s a little harder to achieve this in a closed system, where park fences and human-dominated landscapes make it difficult to move very far. Nonetheless, they will still leave their families for the bull world,",1
"though many no longer live in the open systems that used to exist across the African elephant’s range.

Meanwhile, the females remain together. One possible answer as to why new mothers within a family might be ostracised could be explained by optimal foraging theory, a model of behavioural ecology based on net energy expenditure. An environment with few resources would necessitate a smaller family size in order to maintain fitness. Fitness here refers to the evolutionary context of reproductive fitness over a generation, not in terms of immediate physical health. There has to be enough food for an average family of 15 to 20 individuals to survive, such that genes from one generation are successfully passed on to the next generation. This means that a mother has to be able to get enough food to successfully carry out a 22-month gestation and, after that, be able to eat sufficiently to produce enough milk to sustain her calf for the following two years. Elephant mothers are ‘eating for two’ for most of their adult life, between a 22-month gestation and up to four years or more of nursing before the next calf is born. A lot of resources are needed for a mother to carry a baby to",1
"term and then rear that calf while often carrying another.

When a family gets large enough that there isn’t enough food for everyone as they move through the environment to forage, the matriarch and other dominant females within the family may be forced to make a choice. Whom do they expel in order to keep the family down to a size that would best suit the resources available in this scrub desert habitat? If optimal foraging theory were indeed at play in this desert environment, survival of the fittest could come down to who is the most rigorous at keeping down the family size.

Was my hypothesis correct? Was Zeta indeed more distantly related to the matriarch? My second question was more practical: who was making the decision, and was there a consensus about it? For example, when the matriarch Chilonis and her second-in-command, Cutlass, kicked out Zeta, Zeta’s closest friends, Saber and Katana, didn’t seem to support the action, and yet they went along with departing without her rather than waiting for her.

While pondering these difficult questions, I was also looking forward to seeing the progress of Baby Groot, our star of the previous season. Baby Groot was a member of the",1
"low-ranking Florals, and born with loose tendons in his front feet such that he could barely walk. In fact, he could hardly even stand, which meant he could not nurse. His mother Fresia was so attentive to her poor little calf who seemed destined for the resident hyenas’ dinner. It was horrible to watch.

Something was off, in addition to Fresia’s broken tusk. Her calf was wobbling and tripping over himself

But, to my surprise and delight, Baby Groot had survived. My team and I were watching from the tower as the Florals appeared at the edge of the clearing in late June 2024. It was a bleak, hot, cloudless afternoon, the sky white with dust from Etosha Pan. We got our datasheet ready, labelling it with the date, the time and direction they’d come from, and their family name. As they headed toward the waterhole, I called out the adults (those aged over 20), the three-quarters (aged 13-19), the halves (ages 7-12),",1
"the quarters (aged 6 and under) and the babies for my intern to enter on the datasheet. As ever, it was Rose, the matriarch, in front, then Wisteria, Orchid, Pepper and the rest of the usual suspects, all named with a flower or herb to match them to the family name, the Florals.

At the back, lagging behind the family, was Fresia, a three-quarter female. Fresia was typically in front and easily recognisable by her very thin but long, splayed-out and upcurved tusks. I didn’t recognise her at first because one of those lovely slender tusks was badly broken. And I could see that she was slower than the others because she had just had a new baby.

In addition to Fresia’s broken tusk, I could immediately see that something else was off. Her calf was wobbling and tripping over himself as he tried to keep up. It took me a few seconds to figure out what was going on. It was his feet.

His front feet looked too big for his tiny body, and they were hanging off his ankles like loose slippers that bent backward as much as forward. I had never seen such a condition. It was apparently not uncommon in horses, and easily treatable in captivity. We all stared at this poor creature with a mix of",1
"confusion and horror at his unlikely survival in the wild.

As the family drank, we were able to get a closer look at this poor calf. He kept collapsing, and Fresia kept propping him up using her foot and trunk to pick him up off the ground. I looked at Rose and the other adult females in the family. The fate of this baby lay in their decision: would they embrace this problem and wait for the new mother and son, or abandon them and leave it up to Fresia to protect her handicapped baby on her own?

I had been impressed with how little gap there was between the family and Fresia given how poorly her baby could ambulate. They must have slowed down their progress to the waterhole to accommodate them to some extent. And, given that the whole family was present, they’d likely waited while Fresia gave birth.

Typically, only a small group of immediate family waits for a mother to give birth, and then it takes a day or two for them to catch up with the rest of the family. That was clearly not the case here. They must have all waited together for them to have come to the waterhole as a family like this.

Another thing that was unusual was the particular attention that this calf’s older",1
"brother, Forest, paid to his little brother. This was something that an older sister would do, but not a brother. It was as if he was aware that his mother needed additional support. We watched him take the baby for a ‘walk’ next to the pan’s edge, to allow his mother a break to drink, and decided to name the new addition to the family Baby Groot.

As the family walked out of the clearing, we were all waiting at the edge of our chairs to see if they would wait for Baby Groot to catch up. Sure enough, they stopped midway up the path. Rose had turned around, and the rest of the family stopped, mid-stride, and stood in place. They decided to wait for Fresia and Baby Groot.

This was not what we expected, given the fate of other young females and their calves that we’d witnessed in some of the other families. Watching this interaction filled us all with hope. Baby Groot might just make it.

On the subsequent days that we observed the family throughout the season, we had always held our breath when the Florals arrived at the edge of the clearing – was Baby Groot still with them? Was he strong enough to nurse? Were his feet getting any better? The visits oscillated between nail-biting,",1
"when Groot’s tendons were tightening and he was walking better, but still too weak to stand on his tippy toes to nurse, versus triumphant when he got strong enough to navigate the slippery mud to take his first bath and the other calves reached out to play with him.

To make matters worse, Baby Groot bore the brunt of Warrior aggression that season. Fresia had been so courageous that she would challenge the Warriors for access to the best water. If she wanted a chance at it, she was going to have to risk the safety of her baby to quench her thirst. The second time she tried this, it didn’t end well.

In the confusion of the ensuing scuffle to rest at the head of the spring, Baby Groot had gotten separated and stumbled under the belly of one of the dominant Warriors. She took him and rolled him onto his belly with her foot and could have crushed him by pressing straight down if she’d really wanted to. Fortunately, she did not deliver the killing blow, but it was an extremely tense few seconds. Forest and Fresia quickly came to Baby Groot’s rescue and tucked him under their bellies to keep him away from the remaining jabs.

As surprising as this behaviour may seem, it is not",1
"unfamiliar in humans. Imagine yourself in a similar situation. Your family is part of a desert society, and you have to travel two days to reach a spring in order to fill your water vessels. It is a long walk ahead, and a long walk home. You finally get to the spring, but now it’s occupied by a family that refuses to allow you access to the spring’s source, forcing you to fill your water jugs with muddy brackish water from the outflow. So you resign yourself to wait it out, but then, just as you finally get access to the spring and start filling your jugs, you get chased off again by this same dominant family. They’d already had their fill and were languishing in the shade, waiting to push you off. Wars have been waged with less provocation.

Pushed to the brink, any family of any species might behave aggressively to outcompete others to survive

For elephants in this context, it would make sense to try to avoid waterholes where they would likely encounter dominant families, and instead drink from small seeps, away from danger. But, often, that is only possible when good rain creates more places to drink.

Scientists return time and again to questions relating to the influence of",1
"nature vs nurture, as we search for a deeper understanding of the natural world and our place in it. How many of our behaviours stem from environmental and social influences around us, versus ones that originate from evolutionary pressures? How conscious are we, and can we be, of the influences that inform our decisions?

Pushing other families away from water and rejecting a family member are not behaviours that elephant scientists would characteristically expect in elephants – but, pushed to the brink, any family of any species might behave extremely aggressively to outcompete others in order to survive. Having seen this behaviour manifest into a pattern spanning four different families over the years, the only hypothesis I could come up with was that families had to be smaller to survive in places with so few resources. It was the lifeboat scenario. If you had to choose among your entire extended family for the six spots in a lifeboat after a plane crash in the middle of the Arctic Ocean, who would you choose to join you?

It made sense that elephant families would organise differently if resources were more abundant. It’s akin to comparing a small hunter-gatherer desert",1
"culture of humans in Namibia to a tropical forest culture in the Amazon. Culture is influenced by the resources available, exhibited in the kinds of clothing worn, the types of tools used, and what food people eat. Food availability determines how far a group needs to travel, whether they are following seasonal cycles of prey, as Native Americans followed bison, or an agrarian culture that is more sedentary and doesn’t have reason to migrate.

Historically, elephants were migratory animals, following ancestral paths timed with rain and high-value resources such as fruiting trees. Evolutionarily, elephants were important architects of a once more-forested Africa. They knocked down trees in primary growth forests, which allowed secondary flora to flourish and produce more food for other species. Elephants also passed many seeds through their digestive tract, which facilitated germination. So they were important seed-dispersers as well.

In the more closed systems of Africa today, those migratory routes are truncated, or no longer exist due to human-dominated landscapes outside protected areas. Many elephants are forced to remain in place, which adds to the difficulty of having to",1
"travel further and further from a water source to get enough food, and then travel back to the water, typically in a one-to-three-day cycle. Under these constraints, access to waterholes such as the one within Etosha are critical to survival. The region has only three waterholes, 10 kilometres apart from each other. As a result, competition over access to water can be intense, and conflict is often inevitable, as elephants need to defend such an important resource.

The dominant Warriors, She-Ra (large female in the back) and Joan of Arc (large female in the middle), and their calves, charge the waterhole so they can drink unobstructed by competing families

Our 2024 season ended, with us being confident that Baby Groot could overcome his challenge. But many questions remained. Could the family afford to continue to wait for him to gain enough strength to keep up with the other calves? Would Forest continue to look out for his little brother? Would we see him as a one-year-old the following season?

Over the previous year, I’d tried to avoid the niggling worry in the back of my",1
"mind about Baby Groot’s status. It would make sense if the family hadn’t been able to afford the continued slowdown and had parted with Fresia, who would then be hard pressed to support herself and Baby Groot on her own. The family had other calves to protect too, and they needed to move at a certain speed between food and water sources. It wasn’t likely that Fresia could keep up the vigilance needed to protect Baby Groot by herself. Also, with one of her tusks broken, she didn’t have as many defensive resources as she’d had, to stab at a persistent hyena sensing a vulnerability and trying to separate mother and calf from the others. And Forest wasn’t old enough to intimidate a den of hungry hyenas looking for an easy meal. I was rooting for Baby Groot’s survival, against all the odds. But, as it happened, the 2025 season came to an end without a visit from his family, the Florals.

Our data and analysis showed that none of the subordinate families had shown up to the waterhole. It seemed that the Florals had turned away from drinking at Mushara, where they faced dangerous confrontation by a higher-ranking family, in favour of other options.

Elephants need to be with family, even",1
"if not always welcome. They had nothing else

The Florals weren’t the only ones who didn’t make an appearance. Neither did Kirk, our resident elder male mentor. For Kirk, there would have been way too much male competition around the waterhole for him to have any interest in stepping into the hotbed of young male aggression. We had seen it before. In years of high rainfall offering many other places to drink, a lot of young males experienced testosterone spikes or went into musth early due to the lack of proximity to older males which served to hormonally suppress these spikes. Kirk tried to physically put some of these younger males in their place. Sometimes he succeeded, and sometimes he didn’t. And when he failed, he suddenly became a target of hopped-up young male aggression. He was smart to stay away.

As we packed up our research equipment to leave at the end of our 2025 field season, we had a last visit with the Scimitars at sunset. After all the anticipation of what would become of Zeta and her small family, we were treated to what sounded and looked like a heartfelt reunion. The matriarch, Chilonis, and her dominant sidekick, Cutlass, reached out to Zeta in a boisterous",1
"greeting, with ears flapping, deep rumbling and a trunk in her mouth to welcome her back into the fold after a several-year period of on-again off-again acceptance.

Zeta’s resilience paid off. She was back in the safety of her family, drinking next to her former nemesis, and surrounded by her best buddies, Saber and Katana. Elephants are social animals. They need to be with family, even if not always welcome. They had nothing else.

Buoyed, I had the feeling we’d be seeing Baby Groot as a two-year-old the next season, given the resilience of the Floral family.

A deeper issue lay beneath our research: despite some families responding to resource pressures by fracturing into smaller units, other families remained larger. The low-ranking Pharaohs (another family we followed) had more than 50 individuals but they’d shown no signs of targeting single pregnant females to remove, or of breaking up at all.

The Pharaohs always waited for their elder matriarch, Cleopatra, who I estimated to be about 60. She had grown slower in her age, and yet the whole large family waited for her when heading to the waterhole. Now, I had to ask questions about a matriarch’s character and family rank,",1
"relative to the reproductive fitness of the family. Was aggression a better strategy? Or would Cleopatra show us that her family is just as successful over time as the more aggressive and lean Scimitars and Warriors? Will a low-ranking smaller family like the Florals flourish because they stick together in the face of adversity, even if they don’t get first dibs on the best water? I’m rooting for the Florals. They serve as a reminder of how some humans also show great courage and resilience in the face of adversity – including those trying to monopolise resources for the few. One of the greatest scientific achievements of the previous century was to extend the fossil record much further back in time. When Charles Darwin published On the Origin of Species (1859), the oldest known fossils were from the Cambrian period. Older rock layers appeared to be barren. This was a problem for Darwin’s theory of evolution, one he acknowledged: ‘To the question why we do not find records of these vast primordial periods, I can give no satisfactory answer.’

The problem got worse in the early 20th century, when geologists began to use radiometric dating to firm up the ages of rocks, and",1
"ultimately of Earth itself. The crucial Cambrian period, with those ancient fossils, began 538.8 million years ago. Yet radiometric dating revealed that Earth is a little over 4.5 billion years old – the current best estimate is 4.54 billion. This means the entire fossil record from the Cambrian to the present comprises less than one-eighth of our planet’s history.

Stromatolites were well known, but these, from the Pilbara region in Western Australia, were astonishingly old

However, in the mid-20th century, palaeontologists finally started finding older, ‘Pre-Cambrian’ fossils. In 1948, the geologist Reg Sprigg described fossilised impressions of what seemed to be jellyfish in rocks from the Ediacara Hills in South Australia. At the time, he described them as ‘basal Cambrian’, but they turned out to be older. A decade later, Trevor Ford wrote about frond-like remains found by schoolchildren in Charnwood Forest in England; he called them ‘Pre-Cambrian fossils’. The fossil record was inching back into the past.

By 1980, the fossil record had become truly epic. On 3 April that year, a pair of papers was published in Nature, describing yet more fossils from Australia. They were",1
"stromatolites: mounds with alternating layers of microorganisms and sediments. In life, microbes like bacteria often grow in mats. These become covered in sediments like sand, and a new layer of cells grows on top, over and over. Stromatolites were well known, but these, from the Pilbara region in Western Australia, were astonishingly old. One set was 3.4 billion years old; the other looked like it might be even older, as much as 3.5 billion years old.

Over the past 45 years, palaeontologists have meticulously re-analysed the Pilbara remains to confirm that they are real. It’s not a trivial problem: with rocks that ancient, strange distortions can form that look like fossilised microbes but are actually just deformed rocks. To resolve this, researchers have deployed an array of techniques, including searching for traces of organic matter. At this point, we are as confident as we can be that the Pilbara fossils are real. That means life has existed for at least 3.5 billion years. When I wrote The Genesis Quest back in 2020, I said this gave us a billion-year time window after the formation of Earth in which life could form. Since then, the evidence for life has been pushed further",1
"back in time.

Until relatively recently, many researchers would have said the window was distinctly narrower than that. That’s because there were reasons to think that Earth was entirely uninhabitable for hundreds of millions of years after it formed.

The first obstacle to life’s emergence was the Moon’s formation. This seems to have happened very soon after Earth coalesced, and in the most dramatic way imaginable: another planetary body, about the size of Mars, collided with Earth. The impact released so much energy it vaporised the surface of the planet, blasting a huge volume of rocks and dust into orbit. For a little while, Earth had a ring, until all that material gradually fused to form the Moon. This explosive scenario is the only one anyone has so far thought of that can explain why Moon rocks share similar isotopes with Earth rocks.


It seems clear that, if there was any nascent life on the young Earth, it was obliterated in the searing heat of the impact. Still, this happened around 4.5 billion years ago. What about the billion years between the Moon-forming impact and the Pilbara fossils?

The surface was an ocean of magma that slowly cooled and solidified

We can",1
"divide this vast span of time into two aeons. They are divided by one simple factor: the existence of a rock record. The oldest known rocks are 4.031 billion years old. The half-billion years before that is called the Hadean; the subsequent time is called the Archean.

As its ominous name suggests, the Hadean was assumed to have been hellish. In the immediate aftermath of the Moon-forming impact, the surface was an ocean of magma that slowly cooled and solidified. Artist’s impressions of this aeon often feature volcanoes, lava flows and meteorite impacts.

The early Archean, if anything, seemed to be worse – thanks to a little thing called the Late Heavy Bombardment. Between around 3.8 and 4 billion years ago, waves of meteoroids swept through the solar system. Earth took a battering, and any life would have been obliterated. Only when the bombardment eased, 3.8 billion years ago, could life begin. In which case, life began in the 300 million years between the end of the Late",1
"Heavy Bombardment and the Pilbara fossils.

This was a compelling narrative for many years. It was repeated uncritically in many books about the origins and history of life. Yet there were always nagging issues. In particular, palaeontologists kept finding apparent traces of life from older strata – life that was, on the face of it, too old to be real.

As early as 1996, the geologist Stephen Mojzsis, then at the University of California, San Diego, and his colleagues were reporting that life was older than 3.8 billion years. They studied crystals of apatite from 3.8-billion-year-old rocks from the Isua supracrustal belt in West Greenland. Within the crystals are traces of carbon, which proved to be rich in one isotope, carbon-12, and low in the heavier carbon-13. This is characteristic of living matter, as living organisms prefer to use carbon-12.

Nearly two decades later, the record was extended even further back in time by Elizabeth Bell at the University of California, Los Angeles and her colleagues. They studied thousands of tiny zircon crystals from the Jack Hills of Western Australia. Some of these crystals are Hadean in age: since there are no rocks from the Hadean, these",1
"minuscule shards are almost all we have to go on. One zircon proved to be about 4.1 billion years old. Trapped within it was a tiny amount of carbon, with the same telltale isotope mixture that suggested it was biogenic.

For many years, the sceptics carried the argument, but more recently the tides have turned

Perhaps most dramatically, in 2017, Dominic Papineau at University College London and his colleagues described tubes and filaments, resembling colonies of bacteria, in rocks from the Nuvvuagittuq belt in Quebec, Canada. The age of these rocks is disputed: they are at least 3.77 billion years old, and a study published this June found some of them are 4.16 to 4.20 billion. This would mean that life formed within 200 million years of Earth’s formation, deep in the Hadean.

There are many more such studies. None of them is wholly convincing on its own: they often rely on a single crystal, or a rock formation that has been heated and crushed,",1
"and thus distorted. Each study has come in for strong criticism. This makes it difficult to assess the evidence, because there are multiple arguments in play.

A believer in an early origin of life would highlight the sheer number of studies, from different parts of the world and using different forms of evidence. A sceptic would counter that we should accept a fossil only if it is supported by multiple lines of evidence, as happened in the Pilbara. To which a believer would say: the rock record from the early Archean is very sparse, and there are no rocks from the Hadean at all. It is simply not possible to obtain multiple lines of evidence from such limited material, so we must make a judgment based on what we have. The sceptic would then say: in that case, we don’t and can’t know the answer.

For many years, the sceptics carried the argument, but more recently the tides have turned. This is partly because the fossil evidence of early life has accumulated – but it’s also because the evidence for the Late Heavy Bombardment sterilising the planet has collapsed.

An early crack in the façade emerged when Mojzsis and Oleg Abramov at the University of Colorado simulated the Late",1
"Heavy Bombardment and concluded that it was not intense enough to sterilise Earth. Surface life might have been obliterated, but microbes could have survived underground in huge numbers.

However, the bigger issue is that the Late Heavy Bombardment may not have happened at all. The evidence rested on argon isotopes from Moon rocks collected by the Apollo missions in the 1960s and ’70s. A re-analysis found that those isotopes were prone to a specific kind of artefact in the radioisotope data – creating the illusion of a sharp bombardment 3.9 billion years ago. What’s more, the Apollo missions all went to the same region of the Moon, so the astronauts may have mostly collected rocks from the same big impact – which would all naturally be the same age. Meanwhile, rocks on Earth preserve evidence of past impacts, and they show a long slow decline until 3 billion years ago, or later. Likewise, giant impacts on Mars appear to have tailed off by 4.48 billion years ago. There is also no sign of a Late Heavy Bombardment on the asteroid Vesta.

If the Late Heavy Bombardment really didn’t happen, then it is reasonable to imagine that life began much earlier – perhaps even in the Hadean. The",1
"problem is how to demonstrate it, when the fossil evidence is so impossibly scant.

This is where genetics comes in. Specifically phylogenetics, which means creating family trees of different organisms showing how they are related, and when the various splits occurred. For example, phylogenetics tells us that humans, chimpanzees and bonobos are descended from a shared ancestor that lived about 7 million years ago.

By constructing family trees of the oldest and most divergent forms of life, phylogeneticists have tried to push back to the last universal common ancestor (LUCA). This is the most recent population of organisms from which every single living thing today is descended. It is the great-great-etc grandmother of all of us, from bacteria to mosses to scarlet macaws. Estimating the date of LUCA is fraught with uncertainties, but in the past decade phylogeneticists have started to narrow it down.

One such attempt was published by a team led by Davide Pisani at the University of Bristol in the UK. They created a family tree of 102 species, focusing on microorganisms, as those are the oldest forms of life. They calibrated their tree using 11 dates known from the fossil record.",1
"The headline finding was that LUCA was at least 3.9 billion years old.

It’s possible that life had existed long before LUCA – beginning early in the Hadean

In 2024, many of the same researchers returned with a more detailed analysis of LUCA based on more than 3,500 modern genomes. This suggested LUCA lived between 4.09 and 4.33 billion years ago, with a best estimate of around 4.2 billion.

What’s more, their reconstruction of LUCA’s genome suggested it was pretty complex, with a genome that encoded around 2,600 proteins. It also seems to have lived in a complex ecosystem. In particular, it appears to have had a primitive immune system, which implies it had to defend itself from some of its microbial neighbours.

These details highlight a point that is not always obvious: LUCA does not represent the origin of life. It is just the most recent ancestor shared by all modern organisms. It’s possible that life had existed long before LUCA – beginning early in the Hadean.

This fits with gathering evidence that the Hadean was not so hellish after all. It’s true that the entire planetary surface was molten at the very start of the Hadean, but it seems to have solidified by 4.4 billion",1
"years ago. Evidence from zircons suggests there was abundant liquid water at least 4.3 billion years ago, and possibly 4.4 billion. By 4.2 billion years ago, there seem to have been oceans. These primordial seas may have been considerably deeper than they are today, because Earth’s interior was hotter and could not hold as much water, so for a time there may have been no exposed land – or at least, only small islands.

These strands of evidence amount to a complete rewriting of the early history of life on Earth. Instead of life beginning shortly after the Late Heavy Bombardment 3.8 billion years ago, it may have arisen within 100 million years of the planet’s formation. If so, what does that tell us about how it happened?

The most immediate implication is that our ideas cannot rely on the power of chance at all. There have been a great many hypotheses about the origins of life that relied on a coincidence: say, a one-in-a-billion collision between two biological molecules in the primordial soup. But if life really formed within 0.1 billion years of the planet’s birth, ideas like this are absolutely untenable. There just wasn’t time.

Take the RNA World, one of the leading",1
"hypotheses of life’s origins since the 1980s. The idea is that the first life did not contain the smorgasbord of organic chemicals that modern cells do. Instead, life was based entirely on RNA: a close cousin of the more familiar DNA, of which our genomes are made. RNA is appealing because it can carry genetic information, like DNA, but it can also control the rates of chemical reactions – something that is more usually done by protein-based enzymes. This adaptability, the argument goes, makes RNA the ideal molecule to kickstart life.

They must find processes that work quickly and efficiently to generate complexity and life-like systems

However, a close examination of the RNA World scenario reveals gaping holes. An RNA molecule is essentially a chain, and there are huge numbers of possible RNAs, depending on the sequence of links in the chain. Only a fraction of these RNAs actually make proteins. It’s not obvious how those ‘good’ RNAs are supposed to have formed: why didn’t conditions on the young Earth just create a random mix of RNAs? And, remember, we can’t rely on the power of chance and large numbers: it all happened too quickly.

Instead, researchers now largely agree that",1
"they must find processes that work quickly and efficiently to generate complexity and life-like systems. But what does that mean in practice? There are various ideas. One prominent school of thought is that life formed in alkaline vents on the sea floor, where the flow of hot water and chemicals created a cradle that incubated life. Others have highlighted the potential of volcanic vents, meteorite impact craters, geothermal ponds, and tidal zones: anywhere that has a flow of energy and chemicals.

The reality is that we are dealing with a huge number of intersecting questions. What was the environment in which the first life emerged? What was that first life made of and how did it work? Was the first life a simplified version of something we can observe today, or was it something radically different – either in composition or mechanism, or both – that was then supplanted by more familiar systems?

Ibelieve that the most promising thing to have happened in origins-of-life research in recent years has been a growing willingness to accept uncertainty and reject dogma.

Origins research is barely a century old: the first widely discussed hypotheses were set out by Alexander Oparin",1
"and J B S Haldane in the 1920s, and the Miller-Urey experiment that kickstarted practical research in the field was published in 1953. For those first few decades, origins research was on the fringes of science, with only a handful of researchers actively working on it.

Just as there was no direct evidence that the Hadean was a hellscape, there has been very little hard evidence for any of the competing scenarios for life’s origins. Researchers devised elaborate stories with multiple steps, found experimental evidence that supported one or two of those stages, and declared the problem solved.

What origins research needs is open-mindedness and a willingness to disagree constructively

A small group of people, a lack of hard evidence and a great many intersecting questions: that’s a recipe for dogmatic ideas and angry disagreements. And that’s what origins research was like for decades. I’ve been reporting on the field since the 2000s, and on multiple occasions I’ve seen researchers – including heads of labs – use language that resembled the worst kind of internet trolling. There was a time when I thought this abrasiveness was funny: now I just think it’s ugly and pointless.

What",1
"origins research needs is open-mindedness and a willingness to disagree constructively. That culture shift is being driven by a generation of younger researchers, who have organised themselves through the Origin of Life Early-career Network (OoLEN). In 2020, a large group of OoLEN members and other researchers set out what they see as the future of the field. They complained of ‘distressing divisions in OoL research’: for instance, supporters of the RNA World have tended to contemptuously dismiss those who argue that life began with metabolic processes, and vice versa. The OoLEN team argued that these ‘classical approaches’ to the problem should not be seen as ‘mutually exclusive’: instead, ‘they can and should feed integrating approaches.’

This is exactly what is happening. Instead of focusing exclusively on RNA, many teams are now exploring what happens when RNA – or its constituent parts – are combined with other biological molecules, such as lipids and peptides. They are deploying artificial intelligence to make sense of the huge numbers of molecules involved. And they are holding back from strong statements in favour of their own pet hypotheses, and against other",1
"peoples’.

This isn’t just a healthier way to work – though it absolutely is that. I believe it will also lead to faster and deeper progress. In the coming years, I expect many more insights into what happened on our planet when it was young and what the first life might have looked like.

I presented the hellscape-Earth scenario as a kind of just-so story. Of course, because the data is so limited, we cannot escape telling stories about our planet’s infancy. But maybe soon we’ll be able to tell some better ones. Jesus Christ preached a radical way of living that shifted his followers’ priorities away from the strict observation of Jewish rites and rituals and towards an injunction to love both God and their neighbour ‘as thyself’. Neighbours in this usage was a universal category, including the hungry, poor, sick, and incarcerated – all the individuals scrabbling on the margins of society.

The Gospel of Matthew emphasises the primacy of this responsibility in distinguishing between those who are worthy of the kingdom of heaven and those who are not: ‘For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you",1
"invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.’ Jesus tells ‘the righteous’: ‘whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.’ Throughout the New Testament, Jesus demonstrates a compassion and solidarity with the naked, needy, crippled, and blind, positioning those on the lowest rungs of society as the most beloved of his ministry. In the process, he set the stage for much of the radical Christian thinking that was to come.

When the plague swept the Roman Empire in the 4th century, striking large population centres like Caesarea, Romans fled to evade contamination. Evidence suggests, however, that some Christians elected to stay. The historian Eusebius of Caesarea noted how Christians ‘gave practical proof of their sympathy and humanity. All day long some of them tended to the dying and to their burial, countless numbers with no one to care for them.’ Though exhausted and withered from famine, Christians who remained in the plague-stricken city distributed bread to the sick. Before long, their deeds were hanging ‘on everyone’s lips’.

These Christians",1
"were working to bring the revolutionary spirit of Jesus Christ into the present day

When the plague resurfaced in Italy in the 14th century, a Majorcan Catholic named Roch risked his life by tending to the sick and dying in public hospitals on his pilgrimage to Rome. A century later, the Augustinian friar Martin Luther refused to leave the city of Wittenberg when the plague swept through Germany, opting to stay with his wife and tend to the infirm. ‘Those who are engaged in a spiritual ministry,’ he wrote later, must ‘remain steadfast before the peril of death,’ adding: ‘We have a plain command from Christ: “A good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep …’’’

In the modern era, Christians have pioneered the care ministered in leper colonies, established thousands of mission hospitals, and set up clinics focused on maternal and neonatal health in sub-Saharan Africa. But it isn’t just the sick and dying that Catholics have historically taken up as a moral cause. The Catholic Worker Movement, founded in 1933 by Dorothy Day and Peter Maurin, began as a newspaper: its mission, to let those ‘who think that there is no hope for the future, no recognition of their plight’ know that",1
"‘there are men of God who are working not only for their spiritual, but for their material welfare.’ The Catholic Worker Movement aspired to ‘live in accordance with the justice and charity of Jesus Christ.’ Day, Maurin and other Catholics affiliated with the movement established these ‘houses of hospitality’ all over the US – places where those in need could go for food, shelter and clothing. In the decades during and after the Depression, more than 100 of these houses were founded nationwide (today, there are nearly 150 operating in the US, and dozens more worldwide), some serving thousands of people a day.

A similar drive to seek justice and relief for the downtrodden took root in Latin America following the second Latin American Bishops’ Conference, in Medellín, Columbia, in 1968. There, bishops from Central and South America drafted a series of documents focused on moving beyond Catholic pedagogy and directly improving their parishioners’ lives. The bishops wanted to combat the ‘institutionalised violence’ of poverty in their nations, and began to espouse what would eventually be called the ‘preferential option for the poor’. This revolutionary tenet asserted that God, as he",1
"is depicted in the Bible, instructed his followers to address the needs of the poor first.

These ideas eventually coalesced into what we now know as liberation theology, a politically charged form of Catholicism that swept Latin America in the 1970s and ’80s. Personified by audacious, visionary figures like Gustavo Gutiérrez, Óscar Romero and Leonardo Boff, liberation theology was miles away from any cloistered Catholicism. Instead of sleepy priestcraft and pedantry, these Christians were working to bring the revolutionary spirit of Jesus Christ into the present day. As Gutiérrez wrote in A Theology of Liberation (1973): ‘The denunciation of injustice implies the rejection of the use of Christianity to legitimise the established order.’

While these movements may appear to represent breakaway strains of the religion, they’re all firmly rooted in Christ’s example and the Catholic doctrine that followed. Catholic social teaching is a part of Church theology that consists of seven pillars. Originally laid out by Pope Leo XIII in an 1891 encyclical, the pillars include the sanctity of all human life, prioritising the needs of the poor, the dignity of work and workers, and care for",1
"God’s creation. These pillars are inspired by the religion’s prophets, who, according to the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, ‘announced God’s special love for the poor and called God’s people to a covenant of love and justice.’

Catholic social teaching has been embodied by historical figures like Day, Maurin and Gutiérrez – Catholics committed to action-oriented compassion for those in need. Through their movements and the moral acts they’ve inspired, Catholics are not using their religion to ‘legitimise the established order’; they’re imposing a spiritual responsibility on themselves to change the world for the better and ‘lighten the sum total of suffering,’ as Day put it. This dimension of the Catholic Church can be obscured by the baggage and hypocrisy that barnacle onto many perennial institutions, yet it is critical to understanding how Christianity can be a force for change today. In particular, Catholic social teaching advocates care for the whole of God’s creation, a pillar colloquially referred to as ‘creation care’. This tenet isn’t an archaic, mouldering article of faith, either. The US Conference of Catholic Bishops maintains that care for God’s creation is ‘a",1
"requirement of our faith’, with ‘fundamental moral and ethical dimensions that cannot be ignored.’ While most people may not associate the Catholic Church with environmental justice, many of its most revered leaders have been advocating for Earth for a long time.

Human impact on the climate is calamitous. The global surface temperature in 2025 is on pace to be among the warmest ever recorded; sea levels are climbing; and a biodiversity crisis is rapidly underway, with a 2024 World Wildlife Fund report showing that wildlife populations have experienced an average population decline of more than 70 per cent since 1970. By every ecological metric, the figures are staggering. At first blush, the role that the Catholic Church and its roughly 1.4 billion global followers might play in this planetary crisis is not immediately clear. The Church is not Greenpeace, the Environmental Defense Fund or the Climate Action Network – it isn’t an NGO with an explicit objective to fight climate change, promote decarbonisation, or preserve the world’s languishing biodiversity. What it is, however, is a thought leader with the authority and credibility to influence people’s attitudes and beliefs.

If",1
"you approach the Bible outside of an anthropomorphic lens, you find that even Genesis reveres the nonhuman aspects of God’s creation, notably in passages in which God looks admiringly on plants and animals, land and sea: after each day of layering in one more facet on his loamy canvas, God ‘saw that it was good’. A passel of psalms celebrates the full breadth of creation. Psalm 104, for example, praises a vast ecosystem in harmonious balance: ‘The trees of the Lord drink their fill, the cedars of Lebanon, which you planted./There the birds build their nests; the stork in the junipers, its home./The high mountains are for wild goats; the rocky cliffs, a refuge for badgers.’ If attention is ‘the natural prayer we make’, as the French philosopher Nicolas Malebranche suggested in 1674, then many psalms might be considered exultant prayers for the natural world, testifying to an elusive, heterogeneous beauty.

During his relatively brief tenure as the head of the Catholic Church, Pope Benedict XVI condemned our extractive relationship with the environment. ‘The external deserts in the world are growing, because the internal deserts have become so vast,’ he said during his first homily",1
"as pope in 2005. ‘Therefore the earth’s treasures no longer serve to build God’s garden for all to live in, but they have been made to serve the powers of exploitation and destruction.’

The Church unequivocally recognised the scientific consensus on the warming of the planet

Bartholomew I of Constantinople (technically, the leader of the Eastern Orthodox Church) advocates so passionately for ecological issues that he’s often referred to as the ‘Green Patriarch’. At an environmental symposium held in a Greek Orthodox Church in California in 1997, he became one of the first individuals to articulate a nascent concept that would eventually become known as ecological sin. ‘For humans to cause species to become extinct and to destroy the biological diversity of God’s creation … For humans to degrade the integrity of Earth by causing changes in its climate, by stripping the Earth of its natural forests, or destroying its wetlands … These are sins,’ he said.

Arguably, the single-greatest influence on Catholic thinking about our responsibility to Earth is the encyclical that Pope Francis published in 2015, when climate change was clawing into the global consciousness during the hottest",1
"year on record up to that point. In Laudato si’ (‘Praise Be to You’), Pope Francis drew a sharp line in the sand: the Church unequivocally recognised the scientific consensus on the warming of the planet and humanity’s culpability in it. Laudato si’ is more than a dispassionate document affirming climatological facts, though. It seeks to contextualise the unfolding catastrophe in moral and spiritual terms. Mother Earth, Francis laments, ‘now cries out to us because of the harm we have inflicted on her by our irresponsible use and abuse of the goods with which God has endowed her. We have come to see ourselves as her lords and masters, entitled to plunder her at will.’

Unconstrained by the anodyne, emotionally neutered language of academic science, Pope Francis explicitly ties our environmental crisis to human sin, myopic pride, and an anthropocentric mindset that sees our relationship to Earth in coldly utilitarian terms. His encyclical lays out how the impacts of climate change reverberate through the worlds of plants, animals and vulnerable populations, triggering a cascade effect that imperils both natural ecosystems and the global poor.

In making these connections, Francis",1
"articulates a larger, bolder thesis that frames global warming as a starkly moral issue. Climate change is both a cause and an effect of the extreme inequality we see in the world: one that further victimises the most vulnerable lives while perpetuating the gross power imbalance that permitted it in the first place. ‘This is why the earth herself, burdened and laid waste, is among the most abandoned and maltreated of our poor,’ he writes. ‘She “groans in travail” …’ Laudato si’ is, in many ways, a culmination of many of the Catholic moral crusades that preceded it – ecological sin, liberation theology, the Catholic Worker Movement. Like the poor, sick, and stigmatised, Francis decried how ‘the earth herself’ is now being immiserated by exploitation and indifference.

It is difficult to overstate just how influential Laudato si’ has been to the Church’s followers. In conversations I’ve had with nearly two dozen Catholic theologians and activists, they consistently characterise Francis’s encyclical as a watershed event, a clarion call that connects a veritable scientific reality with the spiritual conscience of believers. ‘Pope Francis writing Laudato si’ was this huge gift to",1
"people who’ve been caring for creation for so long,’ Anna Johnson, the North America director of the Laudato Si’ Movement, told me. When she reached out to fellow Catholics in the wake of its publication, ‘We were all like: “We’re crying with this encyclical – it’s so beautiful.”’

For other Catholics, Laudato si’ offered the opportunity to grow more comfortable in connecting their passion for the environment to their faith. It gave the cartographer Molly Burhans confidence to found GoodLands, an organisation that works to map the Catholic Church’s vast landholdings for conservation and humanitarian purposes. ‘I got the courage to do that from Pope Francis,’ she said. ‘He brought together the best ecologists, the best scientists to consult on Laudato si’.’

The encyclical arguably opens a new chapter in the Church’s history by encouraging the faithful to be more assertive in embodying the environmental pillar of Catholic social teaching. The Laudato Si’ Movement, for example, is a global network that collaborates with hundreds of Catholic organisations all over the world to promote sustainability and divestment from the fossil-fuel industry. In anticipation of the 2015 United",1
"Nations Climate Change Conference (COP) in France, the Movement gathered close to 1 million signatures from Catholics around the world to petition the UN to include language limiting temperature rise to 1.5 degrees. ‘We collaborated in submitting these signatures to both the French presidency and also to Christiana Figueres, who was then the convener of the COP,’ said Christina Leaño, the associate director of the Laudato Si’ Movement. ‘It was the only petition that pushed for keeping temperature rise below 1.5 degrees, and it eventually made it into the final document.’

‘What if the Catholic Church became the largest global network of conservation the world has ever seen?’

Another major Catholic nonprofit, the Catholic Climate Covenant (CCC), takes a grassroots approach by partnering with parishioners all over the US to pursue projects aimed at reducing carbon emissions and promoting sustainability locally. ‘We have close to 400 creation care teams,’ Diana Marin, a programme manager at CCC, told me. Marin continues to be motivated by the legacy left by Pope Francis’s words. ‘Pope Francis spoke about los descartados, the thrown-away people. And so that call to environmental",1
"stewardship or that vocation to care for creation, I think that also calls us to care for those people and to rethink that way of living that throws people and things away.’

The Catholic Church itself has taken some modest steps towards more substantively supporting environmental stewardship. In 2023, the Irish Bishops’ Conference agreed to rewild 30 per cent of all parish land in Ireland by 2030. As the Conference explained: ‘All are called to arrest the decline of biodiversity for the sake of the next generation.’ Several years ago, the Church worked with Burhans to map all the land it owns in the US, for the purposes of eventually maintaining its properties more sustainably. The project saw GoodLands map more than 33,000 Catholic-affiliated properties, producing an exhaustive dataset that integrated the Church’s official directory with assessors’ information and commercial datasets to offer a comprehensive picture of Catholic Church landholdings in the US.

Burhans was enthusiastic – exuberant, even – about the Church’s potential to be a world leader in environmental stewardship when we spoke. ‘There’s something that’s inspired me from the start of this, this super-big",1
"vision/question,’ she said. ‘Which is: what if the Catholic Church became the largest global network of conservation and ecological regeneration the world has ever seen?’

Burhan’s ambition notwithstanding, it may be quixotic to expect the Catholic Church to become a transformative actor in addressing the climate crisis. But it can serve as a lodestar for the world’s billion-plus Catholics by centring the primacy of creation care. People’s attitudes and feelings need to evolve internally before they’re willing to change their behaviours. Because of the way the institution can set priorities for its followers, and impose moral urgency, the Church is uniquely suited to shake Christians out of the inertia – and self-centred anthropocentrism – that’s taken hold for so many. If the impact of Pope Francis’s encyclical is a harbinger and not a blip, it can continue to rouse them toward meaningful action.

The truth is that the Catholic Church is in a far better position to galvanise Christians than its Protestant counterpart in the US. American Protestantism has more than twice as many followers as Catholicism, with an interdenominational movement that encompasses Baptists, Methodists,",1
"Pentecostals and Quakers. Its largest and most powerful contingent, the Evangelical movement, counts nearly a quarter of the US population among its flock. And it is this movement and its flagship denominations – Baptists, Methodists, Lutherans – that have become an animating force in US politics, agitating for the pro-life movement, resistance to LGBTQ rights, and the preservation of a conservative Christian nation (otherwise known as Christian nationalism). These platforms and allegiances make it difficult for the disparate strains of US Protestantism to coalesce around the issue of climate change – especially given its association with progressivism. ‘They basically identify their Christian faith with the cause of American prosperity,’ Norman Wirzba, a theologian at Duke University in North Carolina, and an Anabaptist, told me. ‘They identify it with the flag.’

Wirzba recalls having a recent discussion with several pastors based in the South, on holding a potential workshop about climate issues among their congregations. He didn’t get far before he was sharply rebuffed: ‘It was depressing to hear pastors of major-sized churches tell me that their congregations are not",1
"interested in what Jesus had to say about ethical or political issues.’ Protestant denominations in the US are also the keenest advocates of a personal religion that cultivates a private relationship with Jesus Christ in the hopes of personal salvation. ‘It’s about getting your soul into heaven,’ Wirzba said. ‘It’s a very individualistic faith.’

‘The industrialist who doesn’t care if he leaves the land a foul and hideous place is like the pornographer or hedonist who looks upon the human body as an assemblage of parts for the procuring of pleasure’

Despite its hypocrisies and missteps, the Catholic Church does not suffer from the same co-opting of its identity. It’s also demonstrated a unique capacity to inspire followers to reject the status quo and take bold measures to follow Jesus Christ’s radical example, transcending self-interest and even self-preservation for the sake of spiritual conviction. Whether it’s a moral crusade against poverty, disease or systemic injustice, the Church has long given people the courage to sublimate themselves to a nobler cause. It’s this version of Christianity that can move its followers to see the climate crisis and all the ecosystems it",1
"imperils with the sense of moral urgency and existential consequence they so clearly warrant.

Far from being an obstacle to stewardship, the Church is actually in a position to reframe the conversation using its longstanding moral authority. So much of the way we now talk about global warming and its catastrophic effects are rooted in scientific and economic jargon – statistics, mechanics, technologies, impacts. While these contexts are important, what we so often leave out may be even more consequential: morality.

When I spoke to Anthony Esolen, a Catholic scholar and translator, he referred to our environmental predicament in a language I rarely hear: one of moral accountability. ‘Our whole orientation toward the world is out of kilter,’ he said. ‘Utilitarianism, whose hard side is industrialism, and whose soft and squishy side is hedonism, considers first what a thing can be used for, and not what it is. The industrialist who doesn’t care if he leaves the land a foul and hideous place is like the pornographer or the hedonist who looks upon the human body as an assemblage of parts for the procuring of pleasure.’

This is the kind of language we need now – not the spigot of",1
"data that turns extraction and destruction into sterile figures that camouflage our culpability. The words of past Christian leaders – Pope Francis and ‘los descartados’, Bartholomew I and ‘ecological sin’ – can be an antidote to the utilitarianism Esolen laments, which is currently the chief lens through which our transactional society views creation. Inspired by the ‘justice and charity of Jesus Christ’, as well as the long lineage of believers who strove to personify them, the Church can hold its followers to a higher standard than capitalism, market logic, or any of the other contemporary gods who lord over us today.",1
